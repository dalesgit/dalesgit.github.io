<p>
Parables are short stories that are told in order to get a point across and occur in both testaments of the Bible. The word "parable" (Gk. parabole) was generally used in reference to any short narrative that had symbolic meaning (Louw &amp; Nida 1989, p. 391). There are many stories and saying of Jesus in the New Testament that are identified as parables, but not all of these are parables in the true sense. <b>The Good Samaritan (Luke 10:30-35) may be regarded as a true parable</b> because it is a complete story with a beginning, ending and plot, but the Leaven in the Meal is a similitude, "You are the salt of the earth" is a metaphor and "Do people pick grapes from thorn bushes" is an epigram (Fee &amp; Stuart 1993, p. 136-137). When "parable" is used in this section it refers to the true parables.
</p>

<p>
A true parable then may be regarded as an extended simile (Blomberg 1990, p. 32). It is a story that resembles real-life natural situations and does not contain any mythical or supernatural elements (Kuske 1995, p. 97). <b>These stories were told in order to catch the listener's attention and provoke a response</b>. C. H. Dodd (1961, p.16) defines a parable as: "a metaphor or simile drawn from nature or common life, arresting the hearer by its vividness or strangeness, and leaving the mind in sufficient doubt about its precise application to tease it into active thought." They often embody a message that may not be communicated in any other way (Marshall &amp; Tasker, in New Bible Dictionary:Parables).
</p>

<p>
<b>An allegory, however, is quite different. It is essentially an extended metaphor (Kuske 1995, p. 94</b>) and uses a story or event (often mythical and supernatural) to illustrate a point (Marshall &amp; Tasker, in New Bible Dictionary:Parables). <b>They are stories with 2 levels of meaning: human activity and spiritual reality (Blomberg 1990, p. 15</b>). Allegories encode relatively static series of comparisons that the author wishes to communicate and always need to be interpreted (Blomberg 1990, p. 35).
</p>

<p>
Allegories are much less common in the New Testament but are more frequent in the Old Testament. <b>In an allegory virtually every person, thing, place and event has a symbolic meaning (Fee &amp; Stuart 1993, p. 140</b>). Examples of allegories are the visions in Daniel 8:1-11 (which is interpreted in Daniel 8:20-26), and Ezekiel 1. In the New Testament, nearly every chapter of Revelation contains allegorical visions. <a href="http://hermeneutics.kulikovskyonline.net/hermeneutics/parab.htm">http://hermeneutics.kulikovskyonline.net/hermeneutics/parab.htm</a> (this a strict, even radical, creationist who argues that the truth of scripture extends to natural world issues (science)
