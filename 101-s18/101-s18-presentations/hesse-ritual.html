<section id="slide-orgheadline10">
<h3 id="orgheadline10">Mythos and Ritual</h3>
<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">One of the most common forms of ritual involves acting out or dramatizing religious stories.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">The conjunction of myth and ritual serves as a way for people to participate in the creative power of the sacred.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">In many tribal societies people not only remember the tribal myths but also live them and act them out.</li>

</ul>

</section>
</section>
<section>
<section id="slide-orgheadline15">
<h2 id="orgheadline15">Ritual Reenactment</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">In tribal societies, creation stories may be ritualized through dance and gesture at particular times of the year so that people reenact - the first deeds of gods and goddesses.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">The Greek tragedy is derived from the ritualized worship of the Dionysus.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">The modern drama derives from the acting out of the Easter story in French monasteries during the Middle Ages.</li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-orgheadline12">
<h3 id="orgheadline12">The Passover</h3>
<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">The <b>Passover</b> meal is also called the seder, a Hebrew word that means “order” or “arrangement.”</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Commemorates the meal eaten by the Jews as the were delivered from slavery</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Retelling the story of the <b>Exodus</b> is central to the meal</li>
<li class="fragment appear">The <b>Passover</b> meal is not merely a historical remembrance.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">For Jews participating in the Passover meal, there is a combination of memory, worship, and hope.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">To celebrate the Passover is to become ritually one with those who first observed it before leaving Egypt.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Thus, Jews celebrate an ancient story in their tradition by reenacting the story in a highly ritualized fashion</li>

</ul>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
Note: - At Passover, Jews all over the world gather in their homes to
share a formal meal involving the eating of symbolic foods, various
readings and prayers, and a number of blessings. - The meal is
orchestrated by the head of the household, who conducts it according to
well established traditions.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Passover commemorates the meal eaten by the Jews the evening before
they left Egypt and the enslavement of their people in order to
journey toward, and eventually reach, the Promised Land.</li>
<li>Central to the Passover meal are the great events described in the
Bible in the book of Exodus.</li>
<li>One of the high points of the meal comes when the youngest person
present at the table asks why the meal is eaten. The response comes
in the form of a reading from the haggadah.</li>

</ul>

</aside>
</section>
<section id="slide-orgheadline13">
<h3 id="orgheadline13">Holy Communion</h3>
<ul>
<li class="fragment appear"><b>Holy Communion</b> in Christianity functions in ways that are analogous to the <b>Passover</b> in Judaism.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">The various Christian communities give diverse interpretations of the significance of communion.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">However, all Christian groups agree that when they celebrate the communion meal, they are reenacting events connected with Jesus of Nazareth.</li>

</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>The gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, as well as the letter of Paul
known as First Corinthians, describe a ceremony involving the use of
bread and wine, which are given significance through words attributed
to Jesus.</li>
<li>Holy Communion is a ritual reenactment of this story.</li>
<li>Like the Passover meal, the celebration of Holy Communion carries a
meaning that the community of believers, long after the event itself,
wishes to restate.</li>

</ul>

</aside>

</section>
<section id="slide-orgheadline14">
<h3 id="orgheadline14">Other examples of Religious Rituals</h3>
<ul>
<li>In <b>Shi'a Islam</b>, the “passion plays” of the month of Muharram reenact the martyrdom of Husayn at Karbala in 692 C.E. and draw members of the Shi'i community into an eternal drama in which good suffers in its struggle with evil.</li>
<li>In Shinto, the rituals performed at shrines throughout Japan reenact the conflict between Amaterasu (the sun goddess) and Susanoo (the god of storms) and enable participants to feel themselves a part of the struggle to bring order to the world.</li>

</ul>


</section>

<section>
<section id="slide-orgheadline22">
<h2 id="orgheadline22">Rites of Passage</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">Rites of passage describe those ceremonies associated with the transitional moments in a person's life.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">All religions provide rituals of some sort or another</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Rituals may be turned to be <b>nominal</b> believers to observe customs of tradition (e.g. weddings)</li>
<li class="fragment appear"><b>All rites of passage have three phases&#x2014;separation, liminal, and reintegration.</b></li>

</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Note: - All religions provide rituals and/or theological rationales to
commemorate such moments. - Even nominal believers who feel no great
need to observe most of the customs of a tradition may still turn to
religion for rites of passage.

<h3 id="orgheadline16">Types of rituals</h3>
<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">Birth rituals</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Rites of Initiation</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Rituals of Mourning &amp; Death</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Rites of passage of time, e.g. cycle of the year, cycle of seasons</li>

</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Note: ## Birth Rituals
</p>

<ul>
<li>Although some traditional cultures actually ritualize the moment of
birth, “birth rituals” usually refer to rites connected to the
newborn and its parents.</li>
<li>For Jews and Muslims, circumcision initiates male children into the
religious community.</li>
<li>In Christian communities, baptism makes the child a member of the
Christian church.</li>
<li>Hindus use a ritualized feeding to initiate a male member into the
duties of his caste.</li>

<li>Similar meanings are given to birth rituals in the various religious
traditions, even though the forms are quite diverse.</li>
<li>People celebrate the safe passage of the infant from the womb into
the world; they welcome him or her into the family; they give the
child a name; they pay homage to the creative power of the sacred.</li>

</ul>

</aside>
</section>
<section id="slide-orgheadline17">
<h3 id="orgheadline17">Rituals of Initiation</h3>
<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">Rituals of initiation celebrate and symbolize the passage of a person from childhood into adulthood.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">While the specifics of this rite varied in different cultures, the outlines of the ceremony remained rather constant:
<ul>
<li>ritual segregation from the larger group and some form of testing</li>
<li>the actual ceremonies of initiation</li>
<li>reentry into the group as a recognized adult</li>

</ul></li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-orgheadline18">
<h3 id="orgheadline18">Initiation Rites in Postmodern Society</h3>
<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">In contemporary society, many young people go through a traditional rite of passage, but the “adults” are not really adults for some time after their “passage.”</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Today, the most common ritual of initiation is marriage.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Many elements of the marriage rite hearken back to ancient rituals.</li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-orgheadline19">
<h3 id="orgheadline19">Rituals of Mourning and Death</h3>
<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">Different religious traditions ritualize the mourning process in various ways.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Taoist rites include an elaborate ritual involving an enactment of the soul's journey into the underworld and its rescue and delivery into heaven by ancestral spirits.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Many burial rites symbolize the relationship of human beings to the natural world.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Pious Hindus in India cremate their dead and consign the ashes to the river Ganges as a sign of the never-ending cycle of life and death.</li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-orgheadline20">
<h3 id="orgheadline20">Rituals of Mourning and Death</h3>
<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">Funeral rites are intended to accomplish different ends in different cultures.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">To aid the spirits of the dead to journey through the afterworld either by providing symbolic gifts for them (ancient Egyptians and native peoples of North America).</li>
<li class="fragment appear">To provide living “guides” for the dead (Taoism).</li>
<li class="fragment appear">To help the souls of the dead to purge sin (Roman Catholicism and Orthodoxy).</li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-orgheadline21">
<h3 id="orgheadline21">Temporal Rites and Celebrations</h3>
<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">The observance of cycles of time has been a central characteristic of most, if not all, historic religious traditions.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">For people who hunted, gathered, or planted, the cycle of the seasons was crucial to life. As a result, great celebrations and rituals were associated with the change of the seasons.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Even in modern industrial societies, many of the great festivals continue to take place in conjunction with the change of the seasons.</li>

</ul>

</section>
</section>
<section>
<section id="slide-orgheadline25">
<h2 id="orgheadline25">Religious Meanings of Ritual</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">Ritual is so closely identified with formal worship that one can generally say that the ends of ritual are the ends of worship.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Traditionally speaking, worship promotes one of these four ends or purposes, or a combination of them:
<ul>
<li>Adoration</li>
<li>Thanksgiving</li>
<li>Petition</li>
<li>Penance/purification</li>

</ul></li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-orgheadline23">
<h3 id="orgheadline23">Adoration</h3>
<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">Basically, adoration means acknowledgment of the sovereignty of the Sacred over the person.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Adoration means the acknowledgment that one is not self-sufficient, but dependent.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">In religions with a personal, transcendent God, there are basic ritual gestures assumed in moments of prayer that dramatically illustrate the concept of adoration.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">In religions without a transcendent deity, the focus is on the search for enlightenment and the primary gesture of adoration is meditative.</li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-orgheadline24">
<h3 id="orgheadline24">Thanksgiving</h3>
<ul>
<li>Because one of the basic insights of many religious traditions is that the world and all its bounty flow from the world of the sacred, it is only fitting that such traditions emphasize the need to acknowledge that gift.</li>
<li>The most common form of thanksgiving is the ritual act of giving a gift. Such donations may run from the formal act of a sacrifice, to the leaving of a gift at an altar or shrine</li>
