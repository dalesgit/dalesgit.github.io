<h3 id="org0914bf6">A Notion of Sacred Reality</h3>
<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">A notion of sacred reality establishes a boundary between religion and non-religion.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">“Sacred” indicates a reality that is somehow distinct, “set apart,” “other” than ordinary.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">“Sacred reality” includes the God of the Bible, the Qur’anic Allah, the Brahman of Hinduism, Buddhism’s Nirvana, the kami of Shinto.</li>

</ul>

<section id="slide-orge2b323c">
<h3 id="orge2b323c">Manifest in Human Experience</h3>
<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">Although the sacred is “set apart” from the ordinary, it nevertheless may be experienced, thought about, and acted upon.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Thus, all religion has to do with “the element of the sacred” manifesting itself in various ways: in rituals, persons, and natural phenomena.</li>

</ul>
<hr />
<ol>
<li class="fragment appear">Muslims = the sacred reality (Allah) is made manifest through prophecy</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Buddhists = the goal of Nirvana “comes to life” in the life and teaching of the Buddha</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Navaho = the story of the Navaho people makes wisdom available for those who seek harmony between all things.</li>

<section id="slide-org7fe3459">
<h3 id="org7fe3459">General nature of the sacred</h3>
<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">“Sacred” is a complex word because it is used for a wide range of phenomena: places, time, persons, events, and deities.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">But, generally, when people speak of something as sacred, they mean to designate the thing in question as “other than ordinary.”</li>
<li class="fragment appear">In the broadest sense of the term, the sacred is the “extraordinary.”</li>
<li class="fragment appear">The value of using the term “sacred” is that it is not tradition specific.</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section id="slide-org6123794">
<h3 id="org6123794">The Sacred and The Holy</h3>
<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">Often the words “sacred” and “holy” are used as equivalents.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Thus, the best way to identify the sacred is to identify that which is designated holy.</li>

</ul>
<hr />
<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">The early Israelites were instructed: “Observe the sabbath day and keep it holy.”</li>
<li class="fragment appear">A popular Christian hymn begins “Holy, holy, holy, Lord God almighty!”</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Islamic tradition refers to Jerusalem as <i>al-quds—the holy city, or the city set apart</i>.</li>

<p>
O God, you are my God, I seek you, my soul thirsts for you; my flesh faints for you, as in a dry and weary land where there is no water. So I have looked upon you in the sanctuary, beholding your power and glory. Because your steadfast love is better than life,my lips will praise You. (Psalm 63:1–3)

Thou [God] art the Imperishable, the supreme Object of Knowledge, Thou art the ultimate resting-place of this universe; Thou art the immortal guardian of the eternal right; Thou art the everlasting Spirit. . . . Without beginning, middle, or end, of infinite power, Of infinite arms, whose eyes are the moon and sun, I see Thee, whose face is flaming fire, Burning this whole universe with Thy radiance.

“Its form, O king, cannot be elucidated by similes, but its qualities can. . . . As the lotus is unstained by water, so is Nirvana unstained by all the defilements. . . . As cool water allays feverish heat, so also Nirvana is cool and allays the fever of all the passions. . . . As medicine protects from the torments of poison, so Nirvana protects from the torments of the poisonous passions. . . . Nirvana and medicine both give security. . . . As a mountain peak is unshakeable, so is Nirvana. . . . ” [3]

<section id="slide-org5a7165e">
<h3 id="org5a7165e">The Concept of Sacred Reality</h3>
<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">Derived from the Latin “sanctus”.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">“Sanctus” means “holy” and refers to something separated or set apart from other things.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">The related terms from the Hebrew (<i>kadosh</i>) and the Greek (<i>hagios</i>) mean the same.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">At minimum, the sacred is distinct from the profane.</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section id="slide-org24ad43a">
<h3 id="org24ad43a">Sacred Reality in Various Cultures</h3>
<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">In the Bible, God is preeminently sacred or holy, and everyone else and everything else is holy or sacred only in relation to God.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">In ancient Rome, sanctus applied as much to the place of certain activities as to the activities themselves. 
<ul>
<li>Those acts that were sanctified were performed in the <i>fanum or temple; other acts were pro fanum</i>, that is, performed in front of or outside the temple.</li>

</ul></li>

</ul>
</section>
<section id="slide-orgee126c2">
<h3 id="orgee126c2">Sacred Reality in the Hebrew Bible</h3>
<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">By contrast, the Hebrew Bible uses <i>kadosh</i> to describe God and things set apart by God’s choice: the people of Israel, the land they live in, types of food, modes of human relations.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">There is nothing special about such things except that they are chosen by God or are in some kind of relation to God.</li>

<h3 id="orgcaaf34c">The Sacred and The Ordinary</h3>
<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">The sacred can further be characterized in terms of “the real.”</li>
<li class="fragment appear">The sacred stands for that which provides absolute and objective authority to an otherwise relative and subjective existence.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">The sacred consists of an entirely different order than the ordinary life of human beings, but is manifest through ordinary existence.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Stones, trees, the sky, bodies of water, various people—all these may be the vehicles of the sacred and thus share in its distinctive reality.</li>
