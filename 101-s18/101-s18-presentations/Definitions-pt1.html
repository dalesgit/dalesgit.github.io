<h2 id="orgbc5fd12">Assessing our Spirituality</h2>
<p>
<b>Reflect on your own Spirituality</b>
</p>

<p>
Tell us about your spiritual life. Do you belong to an organized religion? Would you describe yourself as "spiritually thirsty"? Is being "close to God" a life goal for you? Why or why not?
</p>

<p>
Your assignment will be graded an "A" if it meets the following criteria: 1) Your reflection demonstrates that you read and thought about the questions, 2) that you come to the next class and 3) share your insights. A "B" response will be missing 1 of the criteria. A "C" response will be missing 2 of the criteria.

<h3 id="org37dff8d">"What is required is perspective" (p. 8)</h3>
<p>
A North American touring the highlands of New Guinea for a visit to one of the tribes living in the outback might well witness men decorated in bird-of-paradise feathers, nude (save for a penis sheath), covered in ashes, and dancing before a fire at the side of which are pigs bound in vines and banana leaves. His or her first reaction might well be to take some photographs in order to show “the folks back home” some  of the exotic aspects of life among primitive peoples. But this picture can be reversed.
</p>

<section id="slide-org9704e13">
<h4 id="org9704e13"></h4>
<p>
Suppose the tribesmen of the outback visit a downtown church on Sunday morning. They observe rows of oddly dressed people (what, after all, is the purpose of a necktie?), notice that some sit while others sing, listen to one person speak at length, and see still others pass plates onto which paper and metal disks are placed. What are these tribesmen to think? Where, after all, are the pigs? The fire? The sacred feathers? In both cases, the observer lacks a sense of perspective and context. 
</p>

<p>
The lesson is a simple one. It is impossible to get at the intention that lies behind religious behavior unless we have a willingness to <b>enter sympathetically into the cultural worldview of another person</b>, at least for a moment.

November 21, 1768 – February 12, 1834) was a German theologian, philosopher, and biblical scholar known for his attempt to reconcile the criticisms of the Enlightenment with traditional Protestant Christianity. He also became influential in the evolution of Higher Criticism, and his work forms part of the foundation of the modern field of hermeneutics. Because of his profound effect on subsequent Christian thought, he is often called the "Father of Modern Liberal Theology" and is considered an early leader in liberal Christianity. The Neo-Orthodoxy movement of the twentieth century, typically (though not without challenge) seen to be spearheaded by Karl Barth, was in many ways an attempt to challenge his influence.

<p>
The nineteenth-century German thinker Karl Marx, the founder and primary theorist of Marxism, had an antithetical and complex attitude to religion,[1] viewing it primarily as "the soul of soulless conditions", the "opium of the people" that had been useful to the ruling classes since it gave the working classes false hope for millennia. At the same time Marx saw religion as a form of protest by the working classes against their poor economic conditions and their alienation.[2]

His research expressed an interest in the intersection of cultural anthropology and psychology. He was famous for the theory of revitalization movements.[1]

</p>

<p>
Sigmund Freud's views on religion are described in several of his books and essays. Freud regarded God as an illusion, based on the infantile need for a powerful father figure; religion, necessary to help us restrain violent impulses earlier in the development of civilization, can now be set aside in favor of reason and science.[1]

<p>
His most famous work, The Golden Bough (1890), documents and details the similarities among magical and religious beliefs around the globe. Frazer posited that human belief progressed through three stages: primitive magic, replaced by religion, in turn replaced by science

<h3 id="org78980e1">A Definition of Religion</h3>
<p>
<b>cautious, recognizing that we cannot escape our own perspective</b> &#x2026; 
</p>

<p>
The very attempt to define religion, to find some distinctive or possibly unique essence or set of qualities that distinguish the "religious" from the remainder of human life, is primarily a Western concern. The attempt is a natural consequence of the Western speculative, intellectualistic, and scientific disposition. It is also the product of the dominant Western religious mode, what is called the Judeo-Christian climate or, more accurately, the theistic inheritance from Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.

<h3 id="orgdbbcfb5">Religion and Human Thought</h3>
<p>
Religion is intimately connected with human thought.
</p>

<p>
Even those who focus on practice have beliefs, develop doctrines, and emphasize the importance of certain teachings in the religious life essential to their way of life.
</p>




</section>
<section id="slide-orga14fa16">
<h3 id="orga14fa16">Religion and Feeling</h3>
<p>
To some extent, all religious experience is an emotional experience.
</p>

<p>
Friedrich Schleiermacher characterized religion as a <b>feeling of absolute dependence</b>. 
</p>

<p>
Rudolf Otto, characterized religion as the <b>experience of the holy</b>. And this experience is one that inspires feelings of fear, awe, terror, and love. 
</p>




</section>
<section id="slide-orgfbf5562">
<h3 id="orgfbf5562">Religion and Action</h3>
<p>
While the form and place of religious action vary, the importance of action to an understanding of religion is evident.
</p>

<p>
Examples of religious action:
</p>

<ol>
<li class="fragment appear">Islam = the duty of prayer and <b>salat</b></li>
<li class="fragment appear">Shinto = approach the shrine of kami by washing, ringing a bell, and clapping their hands</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Roman Catholicism =  attend mass</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Methodism = outer holiness, inner holiness, spreading holiness</li>

</ol>

</section>
<section id="slide-org1a4bc08">
<h3 id="org1a4bc08">Individual and Social Existence</h3>
<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">Most of the great religions make a place for <b>individual devotion</b> and encourage persons to search for <b>union with the ultimate reality</b>.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">But we must be careful not to overstress the individual dimension of religion.
<ul>
<li>One of the most elementary components of religion is some emphasis on the idea of society.</li>
<li>Thus, the essence of religion is the ways in which it enables individual persons to identify with the values associated with a particular group.</li>

</ul></li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-org4348345">
<h3 id="org4348345">Values and Religion</h3>
<p>
In most times and places, religion has been closely connected with morality.
</p>

<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">To some, religion confirms the moral law and gives one power to perform one's duty.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Religion is a way of expressing important societal values. 
<ul>
<li>For example, when believers in various settings pray or offer sacrifices to honor God, or to ward off spirits that threaten tribal unity, they express their sense of what is important in life.</li>
