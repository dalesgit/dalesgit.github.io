<h3 id="orgheadline3">Summary</h3>
<p>
While imprisoned in a Nazi concentration camp, Simon Wiesenthal was taken one day from his work detail to the bedside of a dying member of the SS. Haunted by the crimes in which he had participated, the soldier wanted to confess to–and obtain absolution from–a Jew. Faced with the choice between compassion and justice, silence and truth, Wiesenthal said nothing.  But even years after the way had ended, he wondered: Had he done the right thing? What would you have done in his place?

These included political opponents (particularly Communists), Slavs,
gypsies, mentally and/or physically disabled, homosexuals, and other
"undesirables." An estimated six million men, women, and children were
killed merely because they were Jews. The destruction of the Jews in
Europe stands as the archetype of genocide in human history.

<p>
Note: Hitler's Nazi government planned a "Final Solution" to the "Jewish
question." After experimenting with different methods of mass
extermination, Nazis settled on the gas chamber as the most efficient.
Death camp operations began in December 1941 at Semlin in Serbia and at
Chelmno in Poland, where people were killed by exhaust fumes in
specially modified vans that were driven to nearby sites where bodies
were plundered and burnt. At Chelmno and Semlin, 265,000 Jews were
killed in this way. - The largest of the death camps was at Auschwitz.
It was originally a concentration camp for Polish political prisoners
but was expanded in 1941 with the addition of a larger camp at nearby
Birkenau. - The extermination of European Jews reached a new peak in the
summer of 1944, after Germany invaded Hungary - The Final Solution moved
into its last stages as Allied forces closed in on Germany in 1944. The
camps were closed and burned down - When the war ended and the
concentration camps were liberated by Allied troops, thousands of
unburied corpses and tens of thousands of sick and dying prisoners were
found crammed into overcrowded barracks without food or water.
</p>

<p>
More camps opened in the spring and summer of 1942, when the Nazis began
clearing the ghettos in Poland and rounding up Jews in western Europe
for deportation to labor and concentration camps such as those at
Treblinka, Belzec, and Sobibor. The largest of the death camps was at
Auschwitz. It was originally a concentration camp for Polish political
prisoners but was expanded in 1941 with the addition of a larger camp at
nearby Birkenau. Auschwitz-Birkenau and its subcamps held 400,000
prisoners, including 205,000 Jews. In the spring of 1942, gas chambers
were built at Birkenau, and mass transports of Jews began to arrive
there. Some were held as registered prisoners, but the great majority
was gassed. These gassing operations were expanded in 1943, and four gas
chamber and crematorium complexes were built. Before they were killed,
the victims' valuables were stripped from them. Their hair was used to
stuff mattresses, and any gold in their teeth was melted down. In total,
about one million Jews died at Auschwitz-Birkenau.
</p>

<p>
The extermination of European Jews reached a new peak in the summer of
1944, after Germany invaded Hungary, and the new (but not yet fully
fascist) Hungarian government fully cooperated in the deportation of
430,000 Jews to Auschwitz in only seven weeks, from May 15 to July 9.
About 100,000 of the Hungarian Jews were selected for forced
labor&#x2014;they were assigned to work in the construction of factories for
German fighter planes and other tasks. Another 80,000 Jews were exempted
from deportation and consigned instead to the Hungarian Army's forced
Labor Service.
</p>

<p>
The Final Solution moved into its last stages as Allied forces closed in
on Germany in 1944. The camps were closed and burned down. Prisoners
remaining at concentration camps in the occupied lands were transported
or force-marched to camps in Germany. Thousands of prisoners on these
death marches died of starvation, exhaustion, and cold, or they were
shot. When the war ended and the concentration camps were liberated by
Allied troops, thousands of unburied corpses and tens of thousands of
sick and dying prisoners were found crammed into overcrowded barracks
without food or water.
</p>

<p>
Much of Europe was destroyed in the war. Survivors of the camps were in
terrible condition, both physically and psychologically. Many lost their
faith, committed suicide, or were otherwise unable to resume normal
lives. Trials were held in Nuremberg in 1945 at which top surviving Nazi
leaders were tried for war crimes. Similar trials followed, but
thousands of war criminals eluded justice. Millions of people were
displaced, feeling unwelcome or unable to return to their former homes.
Israel was established as a state in 1948 and opened its doors to all
Jews, and many of them who survived the Holocaust migrated there, as
well as to the United States, Australia, and elsewhere.

<p>
Note: In Hitler's program for the "Aryanization" of Germany and world
conquest, Jews were subjected first to discrimination, then persecution,
and then state-condoned terrorism. This had as a turning point, the
"night of the broken glass" also known as Kristallnacht, which took
place in Munich, Germany, in November 1938. Nazi storm troopers burned
down synagogues and broke into Jewish homes, terrorizing men, women, and
children. Over twenty thousand people were arrested and taken to
concentration camps. After Kristallnacht, Jewish businesses were
expropriated, employers were urged to fire Jewish employees, and offices
were set up to expedite emigration. Jews could buy their freedom and
leave the country, but they had to abandon their assets when they left.
By the outbreak of war in September 1939, half of Germany's five hundred
thousand Jews had fled, as had many Jews from other German-occupied
areas.

</ul>

<aside class="notes">

</p>

<p>
Note: Jews had been the subjects of persecution in Europe at least since
the seventeenth century. When Adolph Hitler, the charismatic,
Austrian-born demagogue, rose to power in Germany during the 1920s and
early 1930s, he rallied the German people with a message that included
notions of "Aryan," or white, superiority and the inferiority of other
races. The Jews were a special target of his hatred, and they were
incorrectly represented during this time of social, political, and
economic upheaval as being wealthy and in control of the country's
economy. In 1932, Hitler ran for president of Germany. He did not win,
but he did well, and when the party in power was unable to end the
depression, its leaders turned to Hitler for help. He became chancellor,
or prime minister, of Germany in 1933. Within weeks, he set into motion
a series of laws that destroyed the nation's democratic government. He
eliminated all opposition and launched a program of world domination and
extermination of the Jews. His government, like all totalitarian
regimes, established complete political, social, and cultural control
over its subjects.

<h3 id="orgheadline16">Antisemitism</h3>
<p>
"Antisemitism and all other forms of racism present a danger not only to Jews but also to the community of nations. These days the 'new antisemitism' is directed simultaneously against Jews, against Israel and against Zionism. By equating these terms the danger for Jews as a whole is exacerbated. This phenomenon is also common in propaganda emanating from the Arab world. The Holocaust showed the world the extent of the destructive power of antisemitism and racism. Holocaust denial, as well as minimization and banalization of the Holocaust provide a means of avoiding the evident conclusions and learning the lessons for the future. We, the survivors, call upon the world to wipe out these phenomena and to combat them relentlessly." &#x2013; statement by survivors of <b>Shoah</b>
