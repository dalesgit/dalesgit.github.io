<ul>
<li>actually a cluster of "problems" related to understanding <b>Sacred
reality</b></li>
<li>Why does good fortune turn to bad? (<b>Psalms</b>)</li>
<li>Why do the righteous suffer and the wicked flourish? (<b>Hindu</b>)</li>

</ul>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
Note: - The problem of evil actually represents not a single problem but
a cluster of issues arising from the attempt to relate a diverse set of
experiences to notions of sacred reality. - Drawing on the tradition of
his faith community, for example, the psalmist asks, in effect, Why does
good fortune turn to bad? - In a very different context, a critic of
Hindu beliefs asks a different sort of question: Why do the righteous
suffer and the wicked flourish?

<h3 id="logical-dilemma"><a id="orgheadline3"></a>Logical dilemma</h3>
<ul>
<li>In religious traditions that stress the power and goodness of one God
who rules over all creation, the existence of evil presents a logical
dilemma.

<ul>
<li>If God is good and powerful, what is the nature of evil?</li>
<li>If God could prevent evil but does not, can God be good?</li>
<li>On the other hand, if God is good but cannot prevent evil, can God
be powerful?</li>

<i>We have heard with our ears, O God, our ancestors have told us, what deeds you performed in their days, in the days of old; you with your own hand drove out the nations. . . . Yet you have rejected us and abased us, and have not gone out with our armies. You made us turn back from the foe, and our enemies have gotten spoil</i>. (Psalm 44:12a, 910)

<i>The world is so confused and out of joint, why does Brahma not set it straight? If he is master of the whole world, Brahma, lord of the many beings born, why in the whole world did he ordain misfortune? Why did he not make the whole world happy? . . .Why did he make the world with deception, lies, and excess, with injustice?</i>

<li>God is all-merciful. God is all-powerful. God is perfect-justice.</li>
<li>Any 2 of these can be held at the same time - but not all 3</li>
<li>even non-theists must explain the presence of evil &amp; suffering (cf. e.g. a psychologists perspective: <a href="http://www.gurteen.com/gurteen/gurteen.nsf/id/X0038E2E2/">Scott Peck</a>)</li>

</ul>

<aside class="notes">
<p>

</p>

<p>
Note: - When the problem of evil is raised in connection with belief in God or gods, we may describe them as issues of <b>theodicy</b>, or divine justice. - However, even those religious traditions that stress the impersonal nature of the sacred, must seek to explain the existence of evil or suffering in the world.

<p>
Note: - For Jews, the challenge of the Holocaust involves the
relationship of the destruction of Europe's Jews to the notion that
there is a God who governs history according to a plan and that all the
events of Jewish history have a meaning in the plan of God. - For
Christians, the problem is slightly different and involves the following
question: In the death camps, where was Christ?

</p>

<p>
Note: - <b>Karma</b>, signifies the moral weight of one's actions. Good or
proper action results in good karma and in progress toward the goal of
enlightenment. - In connection with the problem of evil, <b>karma</b> is a
kind of inexorable reality that explains the destiny of human beings.
People get what they deserve at least, over the long cycle of time. -
The inexorability of <b>karma</b> is the problem addressed in the Buddhist
story of The Death of Moggallana.

<aside class="notes">
<p>

</p>

<p>
Note: - The brute facts of cruelty and pain are not simply the luck of
the draw, nor are they connected with the will of God. - One who attains
enlightenment knows that the resolution of the experiences associated
with evil does not depend on gods or goddesses, nor does it depend on
other human beings. - In the fundamental sense, the solution to the
problem of evil depends on each individual person.

<b>The Consolation of Promise</b>
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
At some future time, evil will be overcome, justice will be
satisfied, and the point of suffering will be made clear.
</p>

<li class="fragment">

<p>
Such a response uses the language of promise, offering consolation
and hope to those currently suffering.
</p>

</li>

<li class="fragment">

<p>
Just how or when the promise will be fulfilled is a matter on which
there is a variety of opinions.

<h3 id="jewish-perspective-on-evil"><a id="orgheadline12"></a>Jewish Perspective on Evil</h3>
<ul>
<li>Jews wait for a <b>Messiah who is yet to come</b>.</li>
<li>When the anointed one arrives, he will reestablish the nation of
Israel and will rule the other nations with a rod of iron.</li>
<li>some Orthodox groups oppose the nation of Israel <b>because the Messiah
has not yet come.</b></li>

</ul>


<aside class="notes">
<p>

</p>

<p>
Note: - It is significant that a number of Orthodox groups hold that the
contemporary state of Israel is not a fulfillment of this promise. -
Rather, they view the Jewish state as a violation of the Torah, a
manifestation of the impatience and disobedience of humanity rather than
the work of God.

<ul>
<li>Christianity holds that the <b>Messiah has come</b>: Jesus of Nazareth is
the Messiah.</li>
<li>His life, death, and resurrection manifest the promise of God to
bring about a peaceable kingdom.</li>
<li>The work of Jesus is not yet complete, however. For, he will come
again in glory to judge the living and the dead; and his reign will

<ul>
<li>Islam also embodies the promise theme common to Judaism and
Christianity.</li>
<li>An idea appears in the Islamic tradition that the <b>mahdi</b> will come
or appear at the time God decides and will establish the rule of
justice and equity on earth.</li>
<li>Islam also refers to an afterlife in which <b>good will be rewarded,
evil punished, and suffering explained.</b></li>
<li>Through a <b>Day of Resurrection and Judgment, God will resolve the

<p>
<b>Appeal to Sovereignty</b>
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
The sovereignty appeal finds its power in affirming that, at least
from the human standpoint, there are no solutions to the problem of
evil.
</p>

<li class="fragment">

<p>
The book of <b>Job</b> may be taken as the archetype of the sovereignty
response. As such, it has both baffled and comforted believers
throughout generations of Jewish and Christian faith.

<h3 id="the-story-of-job"><a id="orgheadline16"></a>The Story of Job</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>
God tests Jobs faith to see if his obedience to God is motivated by
his own integrity or desire for personal gain.
</p>

<li class="fragment">

<p>
Job rejects the idea that his suffering is for his education or to
make him better
</p>

</li>

<li class="fragment">

<p>
Job also rejects the idea that his suffering is in proportion to some
sin he has committed.
</p>

</li>

<li class="fragment">

<p>
In the end, God claims the wisdom of the creator of all things and
Job accepts the finitude of human understanding and the sovereignty
of the maker of heaven and earth.

<p>
<b>Dualism</b>
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
Evil is the result of a conflict between good and evil powers, <b>both
of which share some of the characteristics of sacred reality.</b>
</p>

<li class="fragment">

<p>
From the perspective of dualism, *God is good but God's sovereignty
faces a severe challenge from those powers that do evil in the
world.*

<li class="fragment">

<p>
Many religious traditions embody elements of dualism, but the best
example is in <b>Zoroastrianism.</b>

<li><b>Ahura Mazdas</b> twins represent the moral choice set before all
