- few parables (**mashal**) from Jesus time are like his
- Rabbinic parables seek to provide greater clarity, whereas some of Jesus' parables obscured things for those who heard. Rabbinic parables are told to answer questions. Jesus often speaks parables to create questions. Rabbinic parables give answers resulting from careful reflection . Jesus' parables force further reflection. Such fundamental differences in both form and function mean that for the most part we cannot appeal to rabbinic writings for assistance in understanding Jesus' story parables.
