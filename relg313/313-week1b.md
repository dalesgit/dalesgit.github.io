# Looking at a text

  Gen. 6 When people began to multiply on the face of the ground, and daughters were born to them, 2 the sons of God saw that they were fair; and they took wives for themselves of all that they chose. 3 Then the Lord said, "My spirit shall not abide [a] in mortals forever, for they are flesh; their days shall be one hundred twenty years." 4 The Nephilim were on the earth in those days --and also afterward -- when the sons of God went in to the daughters of humans, who bore children to them. These were the heroes that were of old, warriors of renown.

-   The timeline of "history" is one of the fundamental ways that we
    find understanding in texts.
-   Gaining a sense of perspective is fundamental to "understanding"
    history

## Simplified hermeneutics


### Meaning found by relating:

<li class="fragment">The time, context, intention of the original item</li>
<li class="fragment">The item itself. This would include issues having to do with language.</li>
<li class="fragment">Our present time, context, and understandings</li>

## Interpretation


*Understanding is all about understanding the text.*

-   What is the text?
-   Who wrote it? What was the context? What was the intent?
-   What does it mean today?
