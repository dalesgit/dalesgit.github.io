## Prophecy at work in the present
Kevin Heider singing “On the Dark Side”

-   ends with quote **Amos 2:1**

> *Because he burned to ashes the bones of Edom's king*

    -   judgment for unrelenting hatred and violence for one’s conquered foe

-   lyrics: <http://kevinheider.com/lyrics-the-spark/>
    -   things are not what they seem
    -   journey in search of riches and wealth (heaven)
    -   only to find hell (death)
    -   "the lords, the gods of nothing" - idols who aren’t really gods
    -   "Emirates" &#x2013; search for wealth and middle-eastern oil
    -   enslaving the innocent
    -   we're not Abraham, honoring God, we're digging holes to bury (hide) our dead
    -   credit is a cancer here &#x2013; injustice wealthy vs. poor
