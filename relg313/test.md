## Further on the sources from which we get our Hebrew Scriptures

- Numerous references to other books:
	- Joshua 10:13; 2 Samuel 1:18
	- Numbers 21:14
	- 1 Kings 14:19,29

---

## Direct circumstantial evidence

- The most obvious is **2 Kings 22-23** which may be a reference to the book that we know as *Deuteronomy*

---

## Deuteronomy

- based on Covenant between YHWH and the people
- Moses is the deliverer of the revelation
- the covenant is "conditional"
	- Dt 27:1 -- 28:68

---

## The 1st narrative of the history of the Monarchy

- Built on the Deuteronomists' theology
- originated independently from the J/E/P material of Gen - Num

---

## An illustration of the transmission of oral history

- The "Singer of Tales" video is a part of a larger examination of the sources and origin of Homer's literature in ancient Greek.
- The text of the Hebrew bible began to take shape roughly in the same time frame
