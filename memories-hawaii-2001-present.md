## 2001

5/5/01

Yesterday, Lydia told me after school that her unbroken record,
stretching back to the beginning of 1st grade had been broken. She had
forgotten her homework on Friday. She had done a great job the night
before to finish, without blemish. This kind of inner striving is one of
her great strengths.

This year saw the culmination of many years of quiet witnessing,
together with God's marvelous serendipity. I had had Brian Jakelski as a
student at St. Joseph's College. He wouldn't have withstood the passage
of time in my memory if hadn't been for the fact that I had had to come
to his aid. He got in trouble with the administration and was threatened
with expulsion or suspension. It had to do with drinking and I don't
know what. In effect I was asked to give a character witness sort of
testimony &#x2013; "he was a diligent student with lots of promise etc. etc."
I think because of the pull of his influential parents he was able to
stay in school and graduate.

Well low and behold he turned up on the scene in Michigan City. He was
the grandson of a stalwart of the parish. (Writing in 2006 I can't
remember her name. She's probably gone by now. She was elderly and quite
frail, living alone in a huge house beside the lake on Lakeshore Dr. She
came down with shingles once. Often wore a back brace. And she
consistently voted in favor of whatever change was needed to attract
young people. Such a sweet spirit.) Well, it turned out that Brian was
devoted to his grandmother and was often at the house watching out for
her.

Brian eventually married and by the time his son was born he had become
an attender at St. Andrew's. David J. & ?? helped to incorporate them in
an oral tradition fellowship group. So we oversaw the baptism and young
Merrick become a favorite of Lydia and Emma. We rode our bikes to their
house several times.

## 2002

First year at St. Mary's. Honeymoon period. Experiencing the indulgence
of Jan Horimoto.

Computer learnings directed at the preparation of the booklet for the
centennial celebration in December. Using Pagemaker &#x2013; so glad to be
able to pass a Pagemaker file over to printer. By 2005 the standard had
become pdf files &#x2013; and since I was using Linux by then, that part was
easy.

Lydia's first year at Kamiloiki included the awesome openness to run for
school office. She was resoundingly defeated. The poignance of her naive
belief in herself inspires me.

Same kind of enthusiasm, that in 2006 I look back on with such
nostalgia, was her desire to play soccer. I was a kind of unofficial
assistant coach in her 2nd season (winter 2003). Later, in 2006, she
confessed to me that she had harbored a dream that she would be chosen
for a "select" team. The coach apologized to me in fall 2005 that he and
his assistant debated choosing Lydia because her spirit, her
coachability, was so strong, but ultimately they felt they couldn't.
Probably much of Lydia's "dream" had been the result of Emma's being so
successful at soccer &#x2013; so that softens the pang in my heart.


<a id="section-2"></a>

## 2003

It would have been 2003 that Emma would have begun soccer. It wasn't
immediately apparent that Emma was a natural player, but she had
enthusiasm and determination that wouldn't quit. Her 1st season was with
U8. Nobody really knew much about playing soccer &#x2013; the rules didn't
even call for a goalie at that point. But later she was playing with
girls that had been playing longer than she and had skills that she just
didn't. She took at as a challenge and by her 4th season she had been
chosen for a select team. Then for a HYSA club newly forming in Hawai'i
Kai.

Emma looked at Lydia with such envy. As a parent it becomes apparent
that these 2 girls look at one another and think the other has
everything they don't. Emma ends up saying in 2005 that Lydia is the
perfect child, the perfect student. That she is just stupid. Lydia looks
at Emma as successful at soccer, a champion at making friends, and
seemingly unaffected by the latent depression that Lydia has wrestled
with since moving to Hawai'i.

Lydia's depression and so much more I perceive as an extension of her
identification with Bridget. By 2005 she sits in front of the tv for
hours at a time, just like Bridget. Lydia echoes B's longing for
Indiana. She takes up her arguments against me, even when it doesn't
involve her thinking. e.g. budgetary conflicts in 2006 re. fixing the
2nd car.

This would have been the summer that B. took the girls to Indiana
without me. I had my first experience of the panic of this, left over
from my experience with the older kids. It would be repeated again in

1.  


<a id="section-3"></a>

## 2004

This would be the year that B's mom would die of cancer.

Return for a few hours to St. Andrew's Michigan City.

In the fall Lydia and I began prepping her for entrance into The Priory.
She had to take SSAT. It was good to coach her to exercise teaching
abilities. I think it was about this time that we began having talks at
night as she went to bed. The one thing I remember from those nightly
coaching and talks was the vocabulary word on the first page of the
practice test: "tenacity." I told her that she had tenacity with her
determination to "do what it takes". She applied it to getting into The
Priory. She showed it in her being elected the reconciler of the year
with the group she was with the previous year at Kamiloiki &#x2013; finding
reconciliation in conflicts on the playground. She understood and
claimed it for herself.

I had become the one to put the girls to bed from Michigan City days. B.
never took it upon herself to practice this great blessing.

While B. was still in Indiana following her mother's death, Emma broke
her nose playing "capture the flag" at school. I was at work when I
received the call from the school nurse. I had left the car at the house
for the Car Doctor to work on. Cal (Christy's grandpa) took Emma to the
clinic in Hawai'i Kai and then on to the church to pick me up as we went
to Kapiolani Hospital for X-rays. Surgery was scheduled after an
appointment with a pediatric plastic surgeon.

I experienced a variation of the agony I had felt with Owen when he got
his ear tubes in Boulder Colorado, summer 1979. I held and hugged Emma
until she was gone, under the anaesthesia &#x2013; it only took a few moments.
Then the wait. She was so brave in wearing the gaudy bandage on her nose
for the days that followed. It was something a badge of importance, I
guess.

Her story of the game that caused the injury became for the epitome of
Emma's spirit of determination. Two girls got to the "flag" at the same
time and there was no way that Emma was going to let her get it. No
pulling back for her. Instead the other girl's head came roaring up to
smash into Emma's nose.

[I'm listening to Harry Chapin right now and the song "Mr. Tanner" has
been so present for me being a parent. Knowing and seeing that my
children start out with a delightful exuberance and passion that gets
crushed by others along the way. They end up only singing for
"themselves, late at night."]

## 2005

This was the year in which Lydia and Emma and I went to Miriam's
graduation in Tacoma. Such a beautiful trip.

Later in the summer B. went by herself to Indiana.

Later still we would all travel to Maui for diocesan convention. Writing
in 2006 I am guessing that was our last vacation as a family. The last
time had been the move to Hawai'i &#x2013; not what B. would call a vacation
in as much as she has repeatedly referred to her agreeing to move her as
a giant concession to me that I should forever after acknowledge.

Visit for a few hours from Bob and Marilyn McKay of St. Andrew's.

Julian was with us for about 10 days in August.

Lydia began school at The Priory.

Emma began playing HYSA with Riggers. First season was in the fall. They
were repeatedly slaughtered by more experienced and skilled teams (e.g.
Chicago Bulls).


<a id="section-5"></a>

## 2006

-   elected to Standing Committee? 6/7, 7/8, 8/9, 9/10

takes the children without me to Indiana.

I experienced my 2nd year of teaching Bible at Iolani. As my colleague
there said, "the first year is shear hell. The second is just hell." I
didn't really experience it that way. I laughed with all but a couple of
days. I set for myself the goal of creating a slideshow presentation for
every one of my lectures and I met the goal. It seemed to help with the
students and helped with my ability to keep on track and to feel
comfortable with the material.

I had wanted to experiment with the increased use of video teaching
methods and I harped with the students that I wanted creativity in their
presentations. Finally, towards the end, one of the students submitted a
video collage on "Greek philosophy." It was masterful, and as my
colleague observed, was probably easy for him to produce. Nevertheless
my own victory was in being able to elicit that kind of work from the
students.

I have written in *The Angelus* about this experience.

Later, I culminated a year of working with the Search Committee of the
diocese by accompanying our candidates on our "fly-about"of the diocese.
I got to visit Molok'ai for the first time.

-   While B. was with girls in Indiana I scheduled 3 weeks with mother that turned into getting George into Hospice
-   George died in Nov. &#x2013; Mom wrote "George left" on her calendar, something she kept at least until 2017, tucked under her large calendar on her desk. She also keeps the light on on the desk "for George."
-   This must be when I went off the Standing Committee, last year as the "President"
