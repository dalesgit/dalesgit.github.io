##  The Appearance of the Sacred

-   The appearance of the sacred is technically called a hierophany, from the two Greek words that mean "to reveal the sacred."
-   The "appearance of the sacred" can be understood as the ways in which the sacred is made manifest in the world of human experience.
-   Examples:
    -   The Angel who appeared to Muhammad
    -   The Enlightenment of the Buddha
---

##  Categorizing Manifestations of the Sacred

-   Patterns of Sacred Appearances
    -   Prophetic
    -   Sacramental
    -   Mystical
-   Sacred Media
    -   Characterizes hierophanies according to the particular vehicle of a sacred appearance.
    -   Sacred media might include sacred persons, objects, time, and space.


---

##  Prophetic Sacred Appearances

-   Identified primarily with Judaism and Islam.
-   Focuses on a person (the prophet) who receives a revelation that deals in various ways with historical events in the life of a community.
-   The prophet is the "sacred media".
-   The revelation is one of the patterns of sacred phenomema.


--

##  Sacramental Sacred Appearances

-   Most apparent in certain forms of Christianity,  Shinto, and various tribal religions.
-   Emphasizes the presence of the sacred through aspects of material reality.
-   Stresses the role of priests or shamans in the community.


--

##  Mystical Sacred Appearances

-   Is most characteristic of Buddhism and Hinduism.
-   However, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam also manifest mystical traditions.
-   Focuses on the importance of a certain state of being or consciousness in the quest for enlightenment or union with the sacred.


---

##  Sacred Persons

-   The association of the sacred with certain persons is a characteristic of numerous religious traditions.
    -   Sacred persons are most obviously found in those religious traditions whose history points to a "founder" or great figure at the beginning of the tradition.
    -   Moses, Jesus, Muhammad, the Buddha, Confucius, and Lao-tzu are famous examples of sacred persons who were also "founders" of religious traditions.


--

##  Moses (Prophetic Pattern)

-   The great prophet of Judaism.
-   In Hebrew, a prophet is one who speaks with the authority of another (i.e. God).
-   Moses' connection with sacred reality is, in one sense, the point of many of the stories told in the biblical books of Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy.
    -   In the biblical stories, Moses' primary role is as a spokesman, that is, a prophet, for the "Holy One of Israel."


--

##. Moses

-   Moses is sacred as a spokesman for God.
-   He brings to the people of Israel the Torah or instruction he receives from God.
-   He receives from God not only the written Torah of the various biblical commandments but also the oral Torah by which to interpret these commandments.
-   In the end, Moses is regarded as the best of all humanity.

11. Buddha (Mystical Pattern)

-   The Buddha is sacred as the teacher of the truth about human existence.
-   The Buddha is also sacred as the sage who, having attained enlightenment, is able to guide others to the experience of Nirvana.
-   Like Moses, the Buddha has a message to proclaim. But the message of the Buddha is not the "instruction" of God.

12. Buddha

-   The "message" of the Buddha is the insight of a master of meditation into the essential nature of all things.
-   As a "sage," he speaks with the authority gained from his personal acquisition of wisdom.
-   Thus, the Buddha grasps something that is, for most, "hidden" (the root meaning of "mystic") and brings it forth.


--

##. Buddha

-   The Buddha gives his life to the teaching of his doctrine, known as "dharma."
-   This dharma teaches that the way to enlightenment is a "middle way," a way given neither to sumptuous living nor to extravagant self-discipline, but to the contemplation of the Four Noble Truths.
-   Ultimately, the Buddha's connection with the sacred has to do with this dharma&#x2013;or the wisdom that he is able to impart to seekers of the truth.


--

##. Buddha

-   The Buddha teaches anyone willing to listen, and he has useful advice to offer, no matter how far short one is of the ultimate goal.
-   For those ready to renounce all in pursuit of Nirvana, the Buddha holds out participation in the sangha or order of monks and nuns.
-   For those less far along, he offers basic spiritual practice, including the "five precepts": avoid taking life (animal or human), stealing, illicit sexual relations, lying, and intoxicants.


--

##. Jesus (Sacramental Pattern)

-   Jesus is the fulfillment of the divine plan that began with the history of Israel.
-   Jesus is believed by some to be the messiah, or Christ, described in the Jewish religious tradition.
-   Jesus is also described as the Son of God, but there is disagreement as to whether this means that Jesus is an actual incarnation of the divine.


--

##. Jesus

-   Classical Christian doctrine views Jesus as something more than a prophet or sage.
-   In his life, death, and resurrection, God is incarnate, or present "in the flesh."
-   The actions of Jesus can be seen as signs of his divine nature.
    -   Healing = God's power over sickness
    -   Teaching = God's willingness to guide humanity
    -   Raising People from the Dead = God's power over death


---

##. Sacred Objects

-   Sacred objects are material items that have, or have had, importance in religious contexts.
-   For example, books, statues, relics, foods.
-   Some communities have perceived sacred reality in rocks, trees, or animals; others have focused on the sky, the earth, or the sun.
-   Even the garments associated with holy persons take on the character of the sacred.


--

##. The Qur'an as a Sacred Object

-   The **Qur'an** occupies a unique place in Muslim understanding.
    -   It is recited in worship
    -   It is an object of ongoing and intensive study
    -   It is the first source for Islamic thinking about law, theology, and ethics
-   The Qur'an is thus understood as a vehicle for the manifestation of sacred reality; therefore, it is a sacred object.


--

##. Tea as a Sacred Object

-   In Zen Buddhism, practitioners attempt to concentrate in order to "**see**" the one thing that is essential.
-   In the **tea ceremony**, attention is given to every detail of the preparation and drinking of tea.
-   Thus, the tea is the focal point of concentration and can be understood as a sacred object in Zen Buddhism.


--

##. Holy Communion

-   In the Christian tradition, some of the most sacred objects are the bread and wine used during communion.
-   In some traditions, the bread and wine are representative of the body and blood of Christ.
-   In other traditions, most notably Roman Catholicism, the bread and wine are in fact the body and blood of Christ.


---

##. Sacred Time

-   In those traditions most associated with a prophet, time appears as the creation and, in a sense, the "field of revelation" for sacred reality.
-   In some religious traditions, the overall conception of **time is linear**: time has a beginning, and it will have an end.
-   In other religious traditions, a **cyclical view of time prevails**: focuses on **repetition**, implying a story of slow yet ceaseless movement around a central point.


--

##. Samsara

-   Popular in the great religions of India.
-   **Samsara** may be translated as "**migration**"
-   Implies the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth that is characteristic of all beings.
-   Samsara indicates a highly developed set of beliefs about personal and historical existence in which time is a medium of the sacred.


--

##. Moksha

-   Both Buddhism and Hinduism speak of **Moksha**: the "release" or "liberation" from **Samsara**.
-   Thus, for Buddhists and Hindus, time is a negative reality to be escaped.
-   Contrast this notion of time with the notions of time associated with religions that worship an Earth goddess.


--

##. Sacred Space

-   Includes traditional places of worship&#x2013; **mosques, synagogues, churches, temples**.
-   Also includes "holy" places&#x2013; **Jerusalem, Mecca, Medina**, etc.
-   In Shinto, the **Torii** marks the entrance to the territory of a **kami**.  The Torii are therefore sacred because they are the dwelling places of important deities.
-   Burial mounds are also sacred spaces.


---

##. Complexity of Traditions

-   The identification of patterns in the appearance of the sacred suggests that there are characteristic "types" of religion, but these should not be pushed too far.
-   **Most religions have complex traditions that incorporate prophetic, sacramental, and mystical components**.



---

##  Sacred Language

-   Many religious traditions possess a sacred language.
-   Examples:
    -   For Muslims, the **Arabic language** in which the Koran is written are Allah's very words.
    -   Many Orthodox Jews refuse to speak in modern **Hebrew** because the language of the Torah is sacred and cannot be used until the Messiah comes.
    -   Many Christians believe that it is a sin to misuse **the name of God** or Jesus.


--

##  Names for the Sacred Reality

-   The term sacred is used to refer to a dimension of reality beyond the world of immediate experience, but one with which human beings have contact.
-   But there are many different names for this sacred reality.
    -   God
    -   Brahman
    -   Nirvana
    -   Heaven
    -   The Kami (sacred beings and powers in Shinto)
    -   Allah


--

##  The Sacred Defies Language

-   In many traditions, there is an attempt to convey that the **sacred defies language** because it is unlike other realities.
-   John of the Cross described his sense of God as **Todo y Nada** (*everything and nothing*).
-   Hindu mystics describe the ultimate principle of the universe (**Brahman**) as "*Neti, Neti*" (neither this nor that).
-   Saint Thomas argued that God's revelation comes to us in **metaphorical language** barely adequate to express the reality of God.


--

##  Forms of Language in the Bible

-   The Bible conveys information in varied styles.
    -   Narratives (e.g., the gospels)
    -   Poems and hymns (e.g., the Psalms)
    -   Proverbs
    -   Legal codes
    -   Sermons
    -   Letters
    -   Stories of beginnings and endings
    -   Parables and ethical reflections
    -   Chronicles and histories


---

##  Myth

-   **Myth** is the oldest and most widespread form of religious discourse.
-   In the field of religious studies, myth indicates a **narrative concerning sacred reality** and its relationship to humanity.
-   In its concern with sacred reality, myth is designed to **disclose the ultimate truth** about crucial human questions.


--

##  Myth as an Explanatory Model

-   Myth is often used **to explain the world** and to answer important questions.
-   For example, myths have been used to address the following topics:
    -   The origin of the cosmos
    -   The final destiny of the world and its inhabitants
    -   How evil got into the world
    -   What the world was like at its beginnings
    -   How the world will eventually end and what will come after that ending


--

##  Creation Myths

-   Every religious tradition has a myth (or story) that explains **the origins of the world.**
-   Examples:
    -   The creation story in Genesis
    -   Stories of great struggles between the Gods
    -   Stories of primordial chaos


--

## Understanding Creation Myths

-   In religious studies, creation myths **should not be analyzed for their factual truth as a matter of historical fact**.
-   Rather, such myths should be analyzed to determine the **basic premises behind the story and the notions of sacred reality reflected in the language and imagery of the creation myth.


--

## Biblical and Qur'anic Creation Myth

-   This creation myth conveys the following notions of sacred reality:
    -   God is not only independent of the world but "stands outside" it as its effortless creator
    -   The world is created as good&#x2013;it is not evil, nor is it an illusion
    -   At the center of creation, both as apex and as steward, stand the primordial man and woman (Adam and Eve)


---

## Myths vs. Stories

-   Myths are stories, but **they are stories of a certain kind**.
-   Myths deal with "cosmic" questions: the origin of the world; the creation and meaning of human beings; stories of a lost paradise or golden age; stories about the end of the world and the manner of that end.
-   Beyond those great mythic reconstructions are other stories&#x2013; **narratives embedded in the historical religious experience of the people**.


--

## Official and Unofficial Stories

-   Every religious tradition has its **official stories**.
-   For example, in Hinduism, the great **Mahabharata** is an epic poem and an "official story" for that tradition.
-   But every tradition also has a large number of "unofficial stories".
-   Such unofficial stories consist primarily of narrative accounts of an individual's personal encounter with the sacred.


--

## The Function of Religious Stories

-   Stories are a kind of discourse that **passes on information, insights, lessons, and instructions**.
-   In this sense, religious stories contain material that people think is worth remembering.
-   Such stories give shape to religious tradition.
-   Religious stories also recall paradigmatic moments and/or persons.
-   Religious stories thus are not simply "handed down"; they provide models to emulate.


--

## The Function of Religious Stories

-   Religious stories are vehicles for disclosure or revelation.
-   Such stories may recount events that could be called "ordinary," but for the believing community, they mediate sacred reality


---

## Sacred Texts

-   In many traditions, religious myths and stories are set down in a written text and receive an official form.
    -   Bible
    -   Qur'an
    -   Torah
-   Many of these books are themselves treated as sacred objects.
    -   Enshrining the scrolls of the Torah in an ark
    -   Kissing the scriptures
    -   Memorization of the Qur'an


--

## Story as Parable

-   The parable is another special type of religious language that is distinct from both myth and story.
-   Unlike the myth, which deals with great, cosmic issues such as origins, the parable deals with immediate, existential realities
-   A parable is a story, usually fictional, in which the narrative thrust is to make a point, but the elements of the story do not always stand for something else. The point to be grasped arises from the story in its own right.


--

## Parables

-   The parable is meant to arrest the hearer or reader in such a way that he or she must think of things in a new and unaccustomed manner.
-   The parable has a certain element of the puzzling or the outrageous that carries with it a kind of "shock value,"which calls into question comfortable assumptions.
-   The gospels depict Jesus as a teller of parables&#x2013;a technique that is also common in rabbinic literature.


---

## Preservation of Sacred Language

-   For many religious people, words have a peculiar power because they point to and/or reveal the sacred dimension of reality.
-   For this reason, religious stories, myths, etc. are preserved within religious communities.
-   Such stories constitute the peculiar memory and the accumulated power of a given religious tradition. In fact, one way different kinds of religions may be distinguished is according to the manner in which they effect this preservation.


--

## Oral Cultures

-   In oral cultures, religious stories and myths are transmitted orally from one generation to the next.
-   Examples of oral cultures abound among the indigenous or aboriginal peoples of various parts of the world:
-   Indians of North, Central, and South America
-   Tribal cultures of Africa
-   Aborigines of Asia, Australia, and New Zealand


--

## Transmission in Oral Cultures

-   The transmission of religious stories may be the special task of certain families or designated "wise persons."
-   Certain stories may be taught to the young of the tribe at appropriate times (e.g., at the onset of sexual maturity).
-   These stories or myths are often told only at certain occasions or at certain times; they are sacred and, more to the point, sacred for specific reasons and specific times.


---

## Scriptural Cultures

-   The word "scripture" comes from Latin and means simply "that which is written."
-   Many of the great religions of the world preserve their inherited past and their religious language in writing.
-   The three great religions of the West are referred to as "religions of the book" because of their emphasis on the written word.
-   However, written records of religious language are also important for the great religions of the East.


--

## Canonical Texts

-   Canon (from the Greek word meaning a "list") refers to a particular set of books or a single book that is authoritative for a religious community.
-   In Christianity, the canon of scripture (the Bible) is the list (canon) of texts read in public worship.
-   In Theravada Buddhism, numerous works systematize and comment on discourses of the Buddha.  But only the collection of texts known as tripitaka are authoritative or canonical.


--

## Why Do Religious Stories Persist?

-   Sacred stories are a means of connecting with the sacred dimension of existence.
-   Religious stories "order the cosmos." The basic purpose of myth is to provide coherence to the world in which the believer lives.
-   With respect to the communal or social aspect of religion, stories give shape to memory; they sustain and nourish a tradition.
-   Also in connection with the communal aspect of religion, stories serve an ethical function.


---

## Language of Theology

-   A theologian is a believer who reflects on the fact of personal and communal faith in such a way as to clarify it and/or to argue that such faith is worthy of consideration by those outside his or her community.
-   Theology is a second level discourse.
    -   The theologian attempts to set forth, systematically and conceptually, the meaning of the stories of a particular tradition.


--

## Visual Language of Religion

-   The visual language of religion includes the use of painting, sculpture, architecture, and the other arts as a means of conveying a sense of the sacred.
-   Long before writing became the primary vehicle for communication, people used visual images to communicate and preserve their religious traditions.
-   The oldest examples of religious language available are paintings (e.g., the cave paintings of neolithic peoples).

    -   The origin of the cosmos
    -   The final destiny of the world and its inhabitants
    -   How evil got into the world
    -   What the world was like at its beginnings
    -   How the world will eventually end and what will come after that ending

##  Creation Myths

-   Every religious tradition has a myth (or story) that explains **the origins of the world.**
-   Examples:
    -   The creation story in Genesis
    -   Stories of great struggles between the Gods
    -   Stories of primordial chaos


--

## Understanding Creation Myths

-   In religious studies, creation myths **should not be analyzed for their factual truth as a matter of historical fact**.
-   Rather, such myths should be analyzed to determine the **basic premises behind the story and the notions of sacred reality reflected in the language and imagery of the creation myth.


--

## Biblical and Qur'anic Creation Myth

-   This creation myth conveys the following notions of sacred reality:
    -   God is not only independent of the world but "stands outside" it as its effortless creator
    -   The world is created as good&#x2013;it is not evil, nor is it an illusion
    -   At the center of creation, both as apex and as steward, stand the primordial man and woman (Adam and Eve)


---

## Myths vs. Stories

-   Myths are stories, but **they are stories of a certain kind**.
-   Myths deal with "cosmic" questions: the origin of the world; the creation and meaning of human beings; stories of a lost paradise or golden age; stories about the end of the world and the manner of that end.
-   Beyond those great mythic reconstructions are other stories&#x2013; **narratives embedded in the historical religious experience of the people**.


--

## Official and Unofficial Stories

-   Every religious tradition has its **official stories**.
-   For example, in Hinduism, the great **Mahabharata** is an epic poem and an "official story" for that tradition.
-   But every tradition also has a large number of "unofficial stories".
-   Such unofficial stories consist primarily of narrative accounts of an individual's personal encounter with the sacred.


--

## The Function of Religious Stories

-   Stories are a kind of discourse that **passes on information, insights, lessons, and instructions**.
-   In this sense, religious stories contain material that people think is worth remembering.
-   Such stories give shape to religious tradition.
-   Religious stories also recall paradigmatic moments and/or persons.
-   Religious stories thus are not simply "handed down"; they provide models to emulate.


--

## The Function of Religious Stories

-   Religious stories are vehicles for disclosure or revelation.
-   Such stories may recount events that could be called "ordinary," but for the believing community, they mediate sacred reality


---

## Sacred Texts

-   In many traditions, religious myths and stories are set down in a written text and receive an official form.
    -   Bible
    -   Qur'an
    -   Torah
-   Many of these books are themselves treated as sacred objects.
    -   Enshrining the scrolls of the Torah in an ark
    -   Kissing the scriptures
    -   Memorization of the Qur'an


--

## Story as Parable

-   The parable is another special type of religious language that is distinct from both myth and story.
-   Unlike the myth, which deals with great, cosmic issues such as origins, the parable deals with immediate, existential realities
-   A parable is a story, usually fictional, in which the narrative thrust is to make a point, but the elements of the story do not always stand for something else. The point to be grasped arises from the story in its own right.


--

## Parables

-   The parable is meant to arrest the hearer or reader in such a way that he or she must think of things in a new and unaccustomed manner.
-   The parable has a certain element of the puzzling or the outrageous that carries with it a kind of "shock value,"which calls into question comfortable assumptions.
-   The gospels depict Jesus as a teller of parables&#x2013;a technique that is also common in rabbinic literature.


---

## Preservation of Sacred Language

-   For many religious people, words have a peculiar power because they point to and/or reveal the sacred dimension of reality.
-   For this reason, religious stories, myths, etc. are preserved within religious communities.
-   Such stories constitute the peculiar memory and the accumulated power of a given religious tradition. In fact, one way different kinds of religions may be distinguished is according to the manner in which they effect this preservation.


--

## Oral Cultures

-   In oral cultures, religious stories and myths are transmitted orally from one generation to the next.
-   Examples of oral cultures abound among the indigenous or aboriginal peoples of various parts of the world:
-   Indians of North, Central, and South America
-   Tribal cultures of Africa
-   Aborigines of Asia, Australia, and New Zealand


--

## Transmission in Oral Cultures

-   The transmission of religious stories may be the special task of certain families or designated "wise persons."
-   Certain stories may be taught to the young of the tribe at appropriate times (e.g., at the onset of sexual maturity).
-   These stories or myths are often told only at certain occasions or at certain times; they are sacred and, more to the point, sacred for specific reasons and specific times.


---

## Scriptural Cultures

-   The word "scripture" comes from Latin and means simply "that which is written."
-   Many of the great religions of the world preserve their inherited past and their religious language in writing.
-   The three great religions of the West are referred to as "religions of the book" because of their emphasis on the written word.
-   However, written records of religious language are also important for the great religions of the East.


--

## Canonical Texts

-   Canon (from the Greek word meaning a "list") refers to a particular set of books or a single book that is authoritative for a religious community.
-   In Christianity, the canon of scripture (the Bible) is the list (canon) of texts read in public worship.
-   In Theravada Buddhism, numerous works systematize and comment on discourses of the Buddha.  But only the collection of texts known as tripitaka are authoritative or canonical.


--

## Why Do Religious Stories Persist?

-   Sacred stories are a means of connecting with the sacred dimension of existence.
-   Religious stories "order the cosmos." The basic purpose of myth is to provide coherence to the world in which the believer lives.
-   With respect to the communal or social aspect of religion, stories give shape to memory; they sustain and nourish a tradition.
-   Also in connection with the communal aspect of religion, stories serve an ethical function.


---

## Language of Theology

-   A theologian is a believer who reflects on the fact of personal and communal faith in such a way as to clarify it and/or to argue that such faith is worthy of consideration by those outside his or her community.
-   Theology is a second level discourse.
    -   The theologian attempts to set forth, systematically and conceptually, the meaning of the stories of a particular tradition.


--

## Visual Language of Religion

-   The visual language of religion includes the use of painting, sculpture, architecture, and the other arts as a means of conveying a sense of the sacred.
-   Long before writing became the primary vehicle for communication, people used visual images to communicate and preserve their religious traditions.
-   The oldest examples of religious language available are paintings (e.g., the cave paintings of neolithic peoples).
