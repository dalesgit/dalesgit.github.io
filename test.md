# Isaiah: a composite composition

## Star Wars analogy


-   <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vP_1T4ilm8M>
-   produced by many different "authors"
-   over the course of many years (3 year intervals, 16 years apart)
-   out of order (4,5,6 - 1,2,3 - 7,8,9)
-   a "franchise" cp. a prophetic "school"

Note: interim between the two film trilogies. The franchise depicts a galaxy described as "far, far away" in the distant past, and commonly portrays Jedi as a representation of good, in conflict with the Sith, their evil counterpart. Their weapon of choice, the lightsaber, is commonly recognized in popular culture. The franchise's storylines contain many themes, with strong influences from philosophy and religion.

The first film in the series was released under the title Star Wars on May 25, 1977, by 20th Century Fox, and became a worldwide pop culture phenomenon followed by two sequels, released at three-year intervals. Sixteen years after the release of the trilogy's final film, the first in a new prequel trilogy of films was released. The three prequel films were also released at three-year intervals, with the final film of the trilogy released on May 19, 2005. In 2012, The Walt Disney Company acquired Lucasfilm for $4.05 billion and announced that it would produce three new films, with the first film, Star Wars: The Force Awakens, planned for release in 2015. 20th Century Fox still retains the distribution rights to the first two Star Wars trilogies, owning permanent rights for the original film Episode IV: A New Hope, while holding the rights to Episodes I–III, V and VI until May 2020.

published in order: 4,5,6 -- 1,2,3 -- 7,8,9

# Assumptions: 
The unity and authorship of Isaiah

---

## assumption: 
the title for the book intends to communicate who wrote the entire book.


-   the title doesn't imply authorship, cf. the book of Jonah
-   Job, Esther, Ruth, and probably Malachi are titles of content rather than authorship
-   "Titles" are not part of the biblical text. (e.g. different titles in Hebrew and English)

--

## assumption: 
single books under a single title are the work of a single person


-   clear examples in Scripture where book titles were applied to collections of material by various authors.
-   For example, the book of Jeremiah contains narrative sections describing from a third person perspective actions that Jeremiah took (ch. 37-44).
-   There are references within the book to Jeremiah’s scribe, Baruch, writing for Jeremiah (36:4-8).

Note:
  For example, Isaiah 36-39 is largely duplicated in 2 Kings 18:13-20:19. Also, Isaiah 2:2-4 is repeated in Micah 4:1-3. (thus authorship is not a great concern for biblical text

--

## assumption: 
the concept of "authorship" is a universal idea that applies to any culture in any time period of human history


-   our modern, Western concept of "authorship" is alien to the ancient Eastern world
-   Our assumptions reflect the highly individualized nature of our culture, forgetting that the ancient Near East was far more tribal or communal in its thinking
-   ideas were shared within the community and even passed on from one generation to the next as part of the community.

-   This allowed people to teach or write in another’s name, carrying on the tradition of a master through pupils or disciples who would not only preserve the original teachings but add to them as heir of the tradition.

--

## authorship & discipleship


-   There is evidence within the book of Isaiah that Isaiah of Jerusalem had around him a group of disciples, and that he specifically entrusted them with preserving and transmitting his message (8:16, "Bind up the testimony, seal the teaching among my disciples," cf. 30:8)

--

## assumption: Use by NT writers requires that Isaiah of Jerusalem was the author of all the material


-   this assumes that NT writers had our conception of authorship
-   there is clear indication that NT writers were sometimes uncertain of the origins of their quoted material

---

# A conservative critical reading of the book of Isaiah

---

## Tendency today is to see different periods reflected in book of Isaiah


-   Assyrian threat, Judean collapse, Restoration
-   there are numerous references to the Babylonians
-   Beginning with chapter 40 the Babylonians, and their eventual downfall to the Persians are clearly the main topic
-   There are several references to the temple in Jerusalem being destroyed as if it were an event some time removed in the past (44:26-28, 52:8-9, possibly 51:3)

--

## 3 periods


-   Along the same line, there are numerous references to the devastation of the land and of people carried captive to Babylon (40:1-2, 42:22-24, 43:14, 48:20, 51:17, 52:1-2, etc.).
-   There are several general references to a new leader emerging in Mesopotamia (41:2-3, 25), and two specific references that name Cyrus the Persian as the instrument of Israel’s deliverance from Babylon (44:28-45:3)
-  there is clearly a radical shift in tone and theological outlook in the book at chapter 40

# Isaiah in 8th c.

## 1 Isaiah


-   7:1-17 Sign of Immanuel
-   5:1-7 The song of the vineyard

--

## 2-3 Isaiah

-   understood as a "school" of Isaiah
-   pseudepigrapha will become common
    -   e.g. *Book of Moses*
    -   Community of Beloved disciple

---

# Isaiah of the time of the exile

---

## Isaiah 40:1-11 & Isaiah 52:7-10; Prepare the way of the Lord


-   the "forms" of the former **oracles** are not present in the later chapters
-   no mention of prophet's experience of God
-   no messenger formulas, vision reports, or symbolic acts
-   no call narrative

--

## Who addressed / How is God depicted?


-   Is 52:7 "how beautiful upon the mountains ..."
-   Is 40:2 punishment has lasted 2 generations
-   The city of Jerusalem referred to as "Zion"
-   YHWH both shepherd and warrior king
-   paradox of being connected to the past and experiencing a **new beginning**

--


## Isaiah 44:6-20 & Isaiah 45:1-19; Yahweh is God alone

- "All who make idols are nothing."
- Cyrus called "Messiah" "anointed" in 45:1
- In 45:1-19 how often does God say that there is only one God?

--

## Isaiah 42:1-9 & Isaiah 52:13-53:12; Suffering Servant

- The speaker in both passages is God
- "Former things" used in postexilic prophets to refer to earlier prophecies and histories
- Who is addressed in 42:6-9?
- Who is the "we" in these passages?

--

## Suffering Servant

-   Christian ears hear Jesus as the suffering servant
    -   the one who suffers punishment for the sake of another
    -   "redemptive suffering"
-   How would Jews in the time of the exile have heard the words?
-   Does the Christian understanding overturn the earlier meaning?
-   Possible to have two literal meanings?
    -   one a royal figure addressed to exilic audience
    -   another Jesus, the Christ ("annointed one")

--

## the earlier meaning


-   the identity is contradictory and ambiguous.
    -   some say it is Israel, others a suffering individual
-   The text establishes
    -   servant suffers
    -   servant does not deserve to suffer
    -   servant's suffering pays God back for the sins of others in Israel
    -   Israel is redeemed because of the suffering of the servant
---

-   servant will be in charge of bringing justice
-   royal imagery is used
-   the people describe themselves as "sheep" (53:6) which suggests the servant is a shepherd
