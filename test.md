##  Word Play
Blessed    : The word that inaugurates the psalm and the book of psalms has sometimes been
translated as praises, a noun form, though this would be an unusual rendering--not to mention
the fact that many of the psalms are, in fact, more complaints than praises. More likely it should
be read adjectivally, meaning praised or blessed. The medieval Jewish commentator Malbim sees
it as particularly referring to contentment in the spiritual realm, an understanding that I share.
The idea of longevity of spiritual contentment is a connotation that I was unable to easily
represent in translation, but which I attempt to convey through this word.

who     : A word that means "which" or "that." It is pronounced asher. Note the play on
ashrei above. Word play and resonance is common throughout the psalms. Here the assonance of
the two words suggests an almost causal equation: A person who does what follows will for that
reason be happy.
