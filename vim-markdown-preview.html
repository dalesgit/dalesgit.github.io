<p>I sit down to write. I am looking for my voice. The struggle is great to
put in place the discipline. I feel the passing of time so swift these
days. For so long I have felt deep within me the pull of witing. It was
over 15 years ago, when I lost daily contact with my children through
divorce and separation, that I first felt the desire to pass on
something of me, perchance even something of value, to them.</p>
<p>Frequently through the years, I have remembered driving through the
Arizona desert with my family. The year was probably 1956 or 1957. My
father drove his Pontiac, the car with distnctive marks like a Buick.
The paved road passed up and down across arroyos. At the time it meant
little to me. Later, as we became accustomed to Eisenhower's interstate
highway system, those roads seemed so quaint, at times flooded as they
passed across a "crick." The memory is of no particular value. But it
seems to point to something I want to hand on to my children. A
connection with a past that they do not know? A route through the lost
map of memory into their present? I don't know. But it motivates me
nonetheless.</p>
<p>I have a real fear of putting down words that deliver just an
excruciating common-place. Perhaps I have reached the age where a
greater fear is in not leaving anything at all to my children. I
experienced my older children as stolen from my life at an early age. My
younger children will not get to know me in their middle age. Perhaps
the mystery of syntax, ordinary words linked together, will communicate
something of value to them.</p>
<p>I am currently wed to a woman who obsessively rehearses the shared,
corporate memory of her family. "Nana always did …" "Jacob patiently
helped me get dressed when I broke my arm." I frequently think that she
experiences and understands present experience only as reflections of
her past. It feels like a prison to me. And yet I understand the
fundamental truth in her approach, that we are in many ways at least,
the product of who we have been.</p>

<p>Memory,of course, doesn't stretch back to one's birth. What we
consciously pass on from that period we learn at a later age. It is only
the remembered legacy, not the real thing.</p>
<p>In 2002, on our way to a move to Honolulu, I contrived to drive through
the Arizona desert so that I could see the place of my birth. I knew
that I would not be able to see a familiar kind of nostalgia. Long
before I had learned that Ray, Arizona had been abandoned in order to
make way for the copper mine that had been the town's reason for
existence. By the 1980's it seemed a fit part of my public story that
the town I was born in no longer existed.</p>
<p>After leaving the army air force that had helped pay for my father's
medical schooling, he had taken a job as a company physician. From the
midwest of his origins, he and his wife traveled to the western desert
and set up a home. He would never again think of the midwest, Illinois
along the Mississippi River, as home.</p>
<p>My parents described the hospital in which I was born as a small
building, only a few rooms. I remember seeing a photograph of it
somewhere.</p>
<p>The dusty hot vision that met us on the drive was not at all romantic.
It took us some asking around to get close enough to the pit to even
make it out. Ray, of course, was not on the road map, so I couldn't be
confident of where it was. I remembered long ago references to Hayden.
As we drove through that town which was on the map, there were a serious
of copper mine pits surrounding it. I wondered if that was the Ray mine.
We drove, slowly. There was a sign to the "Old Ray Road." We couldn't
follow it because a gate announced that it was private property. But it
pointed down the twisting mountain road. We drove on. Then we saw it,
distant and upward. A monumental set of tailings. And we knew that THAT
was the Ray mine.</p>

<p>I have no memories from this period. What little I carry with me derives
from slides &amp; movies. There are photographs of my grandmother and
grandmother holding me, "Grandpa" and "Nanny". I think, my goodness,
they were only a little older than the age I am now. They looked so old
the last time I saw them, which is probably 25 years ago. My grandfather
would be dead within a few years of the photograph. They looked happy
and proud of their grandson, dressed in a white undershirt and diapers.
My grandfather was so formal, I think the right word would be "severe."
But he was smiling as I remember him.</p>
<p>Just this past summer, at David's, I saw photographs of him as a soldier
going off to fight WWI. He survived that one.</p>
<p>Stories that I remember about him have mostly to do with his practice as
a small town family doctor. My father reported that during the
depression he was paid in chickens and the like. I don't know where he
studied to be a doctor, but I think I remember someone telling me that
it was a rather informal affair, almost an apprenticeship. I heard many
times from my mother that my own father became a physician because his
father had expected it.</p>
<p>My grandfather's birth and childhood is shrouded in unknown by me. His
geographical background was southern Illinois and Kentucky. He ended up
settling further north in Illinois, along the Mississippi river, right
where it juts out to the west, in Hamilton, Illinois.</p>
<p>From a later time, after my grandfather's death from heart attack at age
62, I do have lots of memories of the house my father grew up in there
in Hamilton. Originally half had been the living quarters and half was
the office with examination room. By the time I remember it, it had been
converted to living quarters.</p>
<p>Further photographic memories of my life in Ray include the movie scene
of me pulling my baby sister around in a wagon – the shaky 8mm film
seeming to cast the scene back into the 1920's of silent films.</p>
<p>There was a house-keeper who kept flitting in and out of the scene,
protective of the little baby girl and afraid that I was going to hurt
her. She was the first of many "characters" who came to live with us
over the years. I recognize, now, that my mother was accustomed to
acting the part of the physician's wife, so it was appropriate that she
have a nanny. Later, after my parents were divorced, it seemed to me
growing up that my mother reached out to handicapped or outcasts. Of
course they did help her to raise 4 children and work full-time. The
only name I remember was from a time when I was 15-16, it was "Spitzy",
short for Spitzfaden.</p>

<p>What used to be my earliest memory: a birthday party. I've mostly lost
that, even as the memory of a memory, which it was for a long time.</p>
<p>Somewhat closer is the memory of riding my tricycle past the end of the
block, beyond which I was not supposed to go. I kept going. I went
several blocks before I realized I was lost. I don't really remember how
I got home, but I think someone in the neighborhood may have recognized
that I was too far from home and returned me. My recollection, hazy at
it is, is that I wasn't so much punished for that infraction because my
mother was so relieved to have me found.</p>
<p>Even more vivid is the time I played bounce the ball against the storm
windows my father was cleaning, leaned up against the side of the house.
I can remember the thought processes going on, possibly because I have
retold the story a number of times. It started with bouncing the ball
against the side of the house. My aim went astray and one of the throws
hit the glass of the window. I thought, "How cool, the glass doesn't
break." So I tried it again, with different results this time. I was so
afraid of my father's anger that I ran into the garage, attempting to
hide. Funny how silly our thought processes seem from just a little ways
down the road. Again, my memory is that I wasn't severely punished,
perhaps because my parents thought that I had already punished myself.</p>
<p>The house was a little white box of a thing. Driving past in later
years, it seemed so tiny.</p>
<p>My father's move to setting up a practice in Denver. Kincaid's pharmacy
where everyone knew him and we treated as special – eating at the
fountain there.</p>

<li>
<p>Travel to Ray: up/down road, blind single lane, pencil into hand,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shirley's burn</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As with the earlier memories, I have trouble now, at age 56, knowing
whether I have the memory, or whether I have the memory of the memory.</p>
<p>Driving in our father's Pontiac. He always owned Pontiacs, and I
remember him saying more than once, "I dream of owning a Cadillac
someday." He never did, though he could have if he had really wanted it.
The memory is of driving on a paved road that was just a curvy layer of
asphalt laid on the desert floor. It went up and around. In particular
this was my introduction, via my parents' stern warning, that arroyos
were very dangerous and could be flooded without warning at any moment.
The storms might well be occurring so far in the distance that we
wouldn't know about it, but down would come rushing the water.</p>
<p>I also remember hearing from my parents during this period about the
experience they had had of driving on these bare asphalt roads and the
crunch of tarantulas, escaping the water, would be noticeable, even
through the hunk of iron that were American cars during the 50's.</p>
<p>This memory recalls the crib that all of us Hathaway's slept in,
purchased in Ray, Arizona, that was made up of screen mesh rather than
the usual wooden posts. Many people who saw it remarked that it looked
like a cage. And indeed it could be made to function as a cage, with its
own lid. But the "cage" was to keep the tarantulas and scorpions out of
the baby's sleeping area. I wonder what happened to the crib. My sense
is that at least Owen slept in it. But I could be wrong.</p>
<p>During a visit we made at this time, to see the friends my parents had
made in Ray, we stayed for a week or so with one of them. I can't
remember their names, but they had children a few years older than
Shirley and me. They had a heating system in their home that functioned
by forcing the heated air up into the middle of the house – in a corner
of the living room. I wonder whether it was a coal fired furnace? (I
need to write later of our visit to my grandparents' house in Chicago
and their old coal burning furnace.) Shirley woke up in the morning very
cold and she went and stood on the grating covering the 3 foot square
opening out of which the warm air was emanating. She stood too long,
only a couple of minutes, and scorched the bottom of her feet. They were
branded for many days and she cried inconsoleably.</p>
<p>This same visit had me playing with a fascinating toy that the older boy
had in the household. It was a toy cannon that "really fired things." I
am supposing it came with its own rubber artillery, but I found that it
shot pencils admirably. I tried this a number of times. Then I got it in
my head to cover the barrel with my hand. Perhaps I wanted to see what
kind of force the thing actually had. In any case, this is my earliest
memory of making a bad decision on the spur of the moment. There wasn't
even time to say, "Oops." I had embedded the pencil led into my palm.
For many decades I could still see the black mark in the groove of my
palm line, though now in my 6th decade I can't see it any more.</p>
<p>Billy would have been born this year. As I drudge up memories, I believe
that I used to have a memory of Billy's arrival into the family. It was
one of those early ones. Now, it is all gone and only a faint
recollection that I used to remember it. Was the memory of the meal that
was served when he arrived home from the hospital? Probably my mother
would remember what my memory used to be from the repetition of later
years.</p>
<p>We must have moved, I figured out years later, in order to accomodate
the arrival of this 5th person into our family. So, while I think Billy
may arrived at Quay Street, my only memory of life with him is at 5th
Ave.</p>

<ul>
<li>Kindergarten</li>
</ul>
<p>I am reaching back to the far reaches of my memory to think of this
time. I don't remember moving from Quay St. to 5th Ave. But it is as if
it is the difference between the prehistoric and the historic. Images
and events begin to come into focus for me with the move to 5th Ave.
Some of the images I hang onto from photographs:</p>
<p>the deep snow settling on the house, the image of the family (minus
David, of course) sitting on the front porch. I do have a kind of gut
memory of tunneling in the snow that seemed so deep out front. I wasn't
exposed to that kind of snow until December 1978 at Nashotah House.</p>
<p>I can remember picking out my first 2 wheel bike at some shop. It had a
long hallway, dark and droopy, with tools and parts hanging every which
way, and one was able to "test drive" the bicycle down this long
hallway. Well, I got my bike home and evidently set out to learn to ride
the darn thing. I felt cocky that I could coast down our sloping
driveway. On the 2nd or third repetition I slammed into the mailbox, a
sturdy thing made of 4x4's, and I broke the fork on the bike. It was a
kind of repetition of the example of the broken window from Quay St.</p>
<p>In an earlier effort on this memoir I put down the "fear" that I felt. A
fear of what? A kind of generalized fear of the world. A response to the
fact that I had no older siblings leading the way. I had to do
everything for the first time. There is really much more to explore in
that feeling, especially things having to do with being the
"first-born."</p>
<p>Among the key events of this year was heading for kindergarten. Off to
school. And for the first 3 years of my schooling I had to take a bus
ride. I think the school was named Eiger School. There was an Eiger
Tunnel in Colorado as I recall. It was quite journey for the tender boy
that I was. I have a memory still of the institutional cafeteria that
one ate at at this school I was being sent of to. Trays. Lines. It has
left primordial images for me to this day. It is perhaps the image I
carry for the joke I tell about doctors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A fellow died and went to heaven, where upon he was ushered into the
area of the banquet he was to receive. Unfortunately it was being
served cafeteria-style. Most irritating was the man butting into the
head of each of the lines and getting served first.</p>
<p>Upon asking, "Who is that obnoxious person?" The answer was received,
"That's God, he thinks he's a doctor."</p>
<p>I have always thought that I was allowed to tell that joke since I
grew up with a doctor. But it is much more complicated than that,
really, since I was his namesake, a "Junior", who looked like him</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't remember very much from kindergarten. I remember the mats and
having to take naps. Just a given part of the day that I accepted. Much
of my life I have been that accepting, accomodating good little boy.
Sometimes it serves me well. Other times I am undone by it.</p>
<p>Bridget somehow saw a slew of drawings I did during this period, saved
by my mother. I'm not sure where they are now. But there was picture
after picture of bunny rabbits. For her it is a way of making fun of me.
She would call it teasing.</p>

<p>The next year sent me to 1st grade. Now it would be all day at school.
But I don't remember that being a burden or a fear. It must have been
that I liked school already by that time and looked forward to more of
it. It would have been the year that I began to learn to read. But
amazingly, given the importance that reading has had for my life, I
don't remember the rudiments of learning. All I remember is the
sensation of being able to read. My assumption is that it came easily
and I just marched through the exercises.</p>
<p>Age 6 is when I began studying piano. Again I don't have memories of the
learning of it – only later when I knew the language. I know that I
took to it. Some of it may have been the good little boy, doing what was
expected. Maybe it was that I did have some native talent. In later
years I seemed to regret that I had so many potentialities and so little
in what I could look to as accomplishments. Part of the reason for this
writing is to be able to look back for myself and to say, "Yes, I've
done something with this life that God has given me."</p>
<p>It was during this year that we made a trip to Chicago that still seems
real to me in memory. It was our only visit to my mother's parents home
– the house that she was born in. I remember prowling the basement and
being fascinated by the monstrosity of a coal burner, like a metal
octopus, reigning in the middle of the space. Someone pointed out to me
the window into the small room that was the coal shoot and storage. Coal
would have been delivered to the house through the winged window or
doorway. I think I remember coal dust still in the room. By that time,
however, the house was heated in a "modern" way – I'm supposing oil.</p>
<p>On the side of the basement there was a stairway up to the living area.
It was narrow and dirty, but somewhere alongside it was grandpa's work
space. There must have been a long and narrow bench with tools spread
about. Trying to write about it now, I realize that I don't have very
much in the way of a tangible memory of that. But I have carried with me
all these years a kind of sensation of awe at grandpa's space. It was
maybe one of the few ways that I ever had of relating to him – all of
it through imagination.</p>

<p>The arrival of television into our house is associated with watching one
show in particular. Later there would be Mickey Mouse Club, Howdy Doody
and what not. But the earliest memory I have is of watching Gunga Din.
We gathered around this box that to my small boy's eyes looked to be an
immense tower. And in the middle of this tower was the eye of a small
screen that had moving pictures and sound. The images were powerful to
me, for sure, but the main living narrative about the event has to do
with my sister, Shirley. She evidently had nightmares for years
involving the snakes at the bottom of the pit. It was the death, I
think, the bittersweet ending, that was the more powerful to me, though
I really didn't like those wriggling snakes. I would think of this
moment later when I read 1984, with Winston's confrontation with his
worst fears as the climax of the book.</p>
<p>It was also at about this time that we went to see the movie "Bambi." It
may have been my first real movie. The theater was in the building that
I would later work at, "Little Canino's." What a sensation it was. I was
magically and utterly drawn into the story and devastated at the death
that it fed me. Fear of death. Did it begin then? My father's father and
sister were both dead or dying by that time. Why don't I have any
recollection of it? I only vaguely recall, perhaps from the retelling of
it, that my father drove all through the night back to Illinois.</p>
<p>It was about this time, still at a very young age, when I was first
exposed to the big screen, to a movie theater. We saw "Bambi" – at the
theater in the location of my future work-place while in high school,
"Little Canino's". The movie hit me and took my breath away. It sounds
like a joke to write that now, but the separation between fiction and
reality was shattered to my young person. The fire was fearsome, and
then the death – of a parent. It was all so frightening and
overwhelming.</p>
<p>Not having television for some years, not getting it until others in the
neighborhood already had theirs, meant that we had to go up the street
to view specials. I remember doing this for several presentations from
Walt Disney. Why were they so important? I don't remember.</p>
<p>Second grade was the time that I took my first pride in school work.
There were two of us that were head and shoulders above all the rest in
our reading ability. Evelyn was the other student's name. So she was my
competition. The same kind of emotion was probably present as I felt
myself competing with women in seminary and graduate school – Mary
Schrom and Marva Dawn. From my experiences with them, I guess back in
second grade, if I'd been forced to stay in the relationship with
Evelyn, dork that she was, I would have become her friend. It's the
dorks in my life, I think, who have been my best friends and at the time
I have never recognized it.</p>
<p>Would it have been about this time that I can remember first viewing the
moving pictures that were taken of me and Shirley from Ray, Arizona? I
can still see them in my mind as if it were yesterday. Nanny kind of
lumbering along in the background. Perhaps "grandpa" was in part of it,
too. And I pulled along my little sister in the red wagon, so dutifully,
so oldest-child-ish. The movies, viewed through the years, would serve
to reinforce those narratives that would become so operative in my
future life.</p>
<p>Since I left my first elementary school at second grade, I know that it
was during this period, and up through the summer before third grade, I
think, that we played around the construction of West Lakewood
elementary school. This new neighborhood school was just up the street.
No longer would I be riding the bus, but would be able to walk.I think
my mother accompanied Shirley and me at first. The main memory that
lingers from this construction is one of the mischievous things I was
involved in. There have been those, along the way, though perhaps not as
many as with other children – oldest and dutiful that I was – but
there have been plenty, anyway. I and some friends, in exploring the
construction site, discovered that there were huge sand piles, located
next to the building, and the 2nd floor was not completed and open to
the fresh air. "What a fun idea to climb up there and jump off into the
sand pile!" It was. And we didn't get caught, at least at first. We may
have been warned away in time, or the construction may have advanced to
force the activity away.</p>

<p>Third grade. A new school. This wasn't the year I starred as a student.
That would be the next year. A new school experience, the strangeness of
that, combined with the familiarity of being within sight of my home. It
was an easy transition.</p>
<p>But this would have been the year of extra-curricular activities taking
over. My recollection is that I actually began piano at age 6. Could
that be so? Certainly by this time the piano had become a part of my
life. The 1/2 hour of practice. A part of the rhythm of life that would
stay with me for almost a decade. But it was the language of music that
I was learning at this stage of my life that would remain with me to the
present day. The language, the ability to have some understanding of
this thing we call <em>music</em>, that has been one of the most valuable
things I have acquired.</p>
<p>About this time I must have started playing baseball. Oh I remember that
first mitt my fater bought for me. A flat thing, seemingly from the
1940's. No pocket at all. And he reassuring me that it was good for
developing my skills at fielding the ball. He was probably right, but I
so hated it when I compared it to the mitts of the other kids. I just
wanted one like all the others had.</p>
<p>That whole cluster of emotions could only have happened, however, if my
father hadn't been involved at this stage of my life, with this part of
my life. The piano, of course, was the thing my mother wanted for me. I
now recognize that my father must have felt no connection with that at
all. But sports – he knew sports. At some point I remember seeing
pictures of my father playing football in high school, maybe even
college at Knox College. The equipment so crude, like one sees at a Hall
of Fame exposition. But he was involved with me. He took an interest. In
such a short few years he would be so outside my life, and I would
resent it so. He was never really that involved, but the little bit went
a long way. Harry Chapin's song: "I'm gonna be like you, Dad, I'm gonna
be just like you."</p>

<p>This was the time that I was "marked" as an achiever. Though I had been
a good reader early on, this was the first year I brought home grades
that labeled me "superior."</p>
<p>I was unaware of the conflict my mother had with the teacher, with me at
the center somehow of the controversy. To this day I don't really know.
I think that my mother has responded to my questions by saying something
along the lines that she thought the teacher was playing favorites. Now
the whole thing about this class is that Shirley and I were in it
together. It was a combined 3rd and 4th grade class. Was it that the
teacher favored me over Shirley? That would mean that my mother was
going to bat for Shirley. And my impression has been that Shirley has
harbored a grudge against me her whole life that our mother favored me
over her. Interesting.</p>
<p>This would have been the year that I began band. I had already been
playing piano for several years. So taking up the trumpet seemed like a
snap to me. I don't really have much recollection of the struggle to
learn the basics, perhaps because my basics didn't include learning how
to deal with music, I always felt like I was ahead of the other
students. This persisted for the next few years – I guess until the
competition got stiffer and my natural abilities couldn't carry me as
easily. That would be a theme that would follow me the rest of my life.
I wanted to coast on my abilities, without the hard work that was
required. In graduate school at Notre Dame I wanted to demonstrate that
I could do the hard work. By then it was too late. That and the events
of life overrode my intentions.</p>

<p>Fifth grade. The beginning of the 1960's. Age 10. So long ago, yet the
seeds of so much that is me today can be seen in the memories of that
time.</p>
<p>In music I was feeling like a standout. My piano was progressing and I
applied that native ability to band at school. I felt myself to be one
of the best trumpet players. Then, was it this year or the next?, I
tried to expand to drums. What was I thinking? Today (2007) I am in a
continuing mode of trying to find drummers for the music at church. Just
the other day, after so many have said "no" I thought, well, with the
informality of the 2nd service, maybe I could play drums. And I remember
the terrible failure I was at West Lakewood Elementary.</p>
<p>I suppose that regular rehearsals went OK. I was in a beginning band,
not the advanced one I was used to with trumpet. But then came the
concert for parents. I don't remember what I did, but after trying to
get into the piece (how simple it must have been) the director stopped
us and we started over. I was the cause of the humiliation. Perhaps my
difficulty with rhythm dates from that moment.</p>
<p>I was good at baseball, too, by now. Sometime later my mother would get
us into swimming and I would be good at that too, just as I was good at
skiing. It was a time in my life when I just expected to be good at
whatever I tried. [Oh, I think of the agony I have felt, loving Lydia,
as she has got used to not being good at whatever she tries.]</p>
<p>It was at this time that I was trying to "flex" my prowess that I went
so far as to to physically stand up to one of the interminable
intimidators at school. I quickly got beat and retreated with blood
flowing down my face. My glasses had been smashed into my eyebrow and
cut it good. This was the first time of two that I remember, that my
father carefully stitched my eyebrows. First he cleaned the cut, then
injected it with novacaine. Then stitched it. I can remember repeating
often that I had had 22 stitches in my eyebrows. He was proud of his
work because he was sure that there would be no scar remaining.</p>
<p>Another arena where my physical abilities were put to the test during
this period was in throwing tops. Many of us carried our prized
possessions with us to school and showed off our ability on the square
asphalt playground, containing 4 square marks and tether ball poles. I
was pretty good at getting the thing to land where I targeted, dance on
the string when I asked it to, and outshine my peers. I tried yo-yo's,
too, though I think I wasn't as good with them as with the top. Perhaps
there were too many others who were better than I and I just remember it
differently.</p>
<p>Finally, I note that it was about this time that I must have had my two
adventures with showing and seeing pudenda with neighborhood girls. I
can place it in my memory because it took place before we moved to
Dudley Street in 1960-61.</p>
<p>It took the form of, "I'll show you mine if you'll show me yours." I
have filed these memories under the category of how all children at one
point or another are initiated into the mysteries of sex. The game of
playing doctor. An older initiator. Such are the ways that all of us
seem to follow.</p>
<p>The first time for me was with the older girl down and on the corner.
Were they the Matson's? I think so. The family remained friends even
after we moved to Dudley Street, because I can remember having them for
Thanksgiving dinner. One of those events that I cite often at which our
mother would invite whoever knew who. Teaching us a kind of deep
hospitality. My recollection is that the father of the household owned a
part of a hardware company that later went bankrupt. Mother referred to
them as having "fallen on bad times." He, too, was the one who served on
the jury for the Coors murder trial.</p>
<p>The girl, was her name Nancy?, had babysat us. She may have been the one
to teach my cursive. I was thrilled with seeing her bare vagina.</p>
<p>The second experience, which I initiated, was with the girl on the
corner opposite our house. Somehow even then I thought of her as an
"easy" girl. I suppose she went on to great things, but I lost total
track of her after we moved. We hid in the garage of her house and
pulled down our pants. Again the excitement. But this time I felt the
danger of "being caught." My recollection is that there may have been a
third time in which we did get caught. Have I blanked that out?</p>

<ul>
<li>farewell to elementary school (the dream of long ago of the
institution)</li>
</ul>
<p>I remember the joy and pride I felt in being permitted to ride my
bicycle across 6th Avenue. We had moved. To make room, I would long
afterward figure out, for the arrival of a new child, David, born in
February of 1960. My world had formerly been bordered by the mighty 4
lane road with the major intersection and stoplights at the corner of
Garrison, the same corner that had held the small candy store we journed
to when I was younger.</p>
<p>At the time the biggest journey I had taken, all of about 3 blocks away.
The speeding cars on 6th Ave. formed one boundary of our house, the huge
field to the west formed the other. This was the same field that I
remember walking out into to have a picnic under the tree with Shirley
and Billy. We must have been 7-8 years old. I think there may have been
horses grazing in the field. It was also the same field in which Billy
and I got over our heads with playing with fire. We were lighting
matches, setting branches afire, and it got bigger than we could put
out. One of the neighbors, the man with the girls that Shirley played
with, came to the rescue with his garden hose stretched across the
roadway.</p>
<p>One of the few things that stand out in my memory of 6th grade supports
the view that I was a talent with potential. That mode that stayed with
me, perhaps up to my first couple of years in Hawai'i. Someone with
potential, or offering potential, so would Bridget have seen me as well
as Lucille. I think probably Bob only saw me as a solution to a problem
– his problem was filling a vacancy at St. Mary's. But the memory is of
taking a quiz. I think it was in a subject I liked, history? science?.
But the rather short one page quiz was all true and false questions. It
was something a trick quiz, because all the answers were true (as I
recall) – though they might have been all false. Anyway, only one
person got all the answers correct. Me.</p>
<p>I have written above of the humiliating experience trying to play drums,
but I continued to be one of the best, if not the best trumpet player in
the school. Things were going to get tougher as I went to a bigger
school.</p>
<p>It was this year that I made the transition to Junior High. The summer
had been spent playing baseball. Again, I was good, if not the star. My
position was cemented at 2nd base. But I wanted more. I tried first
base. I had such a good throw that I was played sometimes at 3rd base.
Then it was catcher. I probably began experimenting with switch hitting.
I thought of my father as an ambidextrous sort of person. He could do
such amazing things, I still thought at that age.</p>
<p>My father taught me the phrase about "gentlemen." "A gentleman is one
who is as comfortable moving among the rich as he is moving among the
poor." That's just a paraphrase of what I remember. I watched my
father's hands and fingers as he drew things I could not. I would
recognize them now as technical and scientific in nature, not aesthetic.
But I was still in awe. Was it during this time that my father taught me
that a gentleman always had a clean handkerchief in his pocket, to be
able to offer to a lady. Or was it later? He was soon to be gone from
the house.</p>
<p>So in the fall I began the walk to Junior High. It was on our side of
6th Ave. It was about a mile. I wonder now whether it was that
experience that gave birth to the ongoing dreams of an overwhelming
institution and not the gradeschool. It is a blur to me now. But it was
to be repeated over and over again as I journed into new situations, new
institutions, new expectations of me. That continues to this day when I
wonder sometimes what exactly are the expectations of a clergyman in</p>

<p>So began a chapter in my life as I advanced to junior high school, 7th
grade to 9th grade. The school was located in buildings that had at one
time been a "Lakewood High School," but had for a few years been divided
between an elementary school and two or three large buildings that
constituted the junior high.</p>
<p>Every year of school I began with anxiety about the new things to be
faced and a nagging sense that I didn't quite get it all, that I was
naive of some important piece(s) of information. A result of the
lingering effects of having started school as a 4 year old, I suppose.
Junior high was my third school, so the third time of adjusting to a new
institution. This one was bigger than the rest. And adolescence was
going to happen during these 3 years. They were big.</p>
<p>There was a small convenience type store on the corner. It seemed to me
slightly naughty to go into it. I didn't have much occasion to. The one
thing that I did buy there was cinammon oil, to be used to soak
toothpicks that could then be chewed on. Why did that seem like
something I wasn't supposed to do? Because I was a goody two shoes?
Because it was a "hoody" thing to do?</p>
<p>Eventually there was a McDonalds hamburger stand built next to the shop.
And, of course, in time all of it would be razed for progress. But that
McDonalds was an almost magical sort of place. All made of bright
colored plastic. And these tasty things you could order by walking up to
the window. Previously the only thing I really knew like that was some
ice cream stands on Colfax Ave. – at least I think they were around
first. That McDonalds had to be one of the early ones to go up in Denver
– maybe even nationally. We didn't eat the food from it very often and
certainly didn't think of it as a place to get a "meal." It was for
in-between-meals.</p>
<p>7th grade was the year I took Spanish. We had had some exposure to it in
grade school. It seemed like the obvious and easy choice when I had been
filling out schedules. There were probably lots of sections of it. I did
not like the class.</p>
<p>That foreign language was my first awareness of not being particularly
skilled at languages. I know that many through the years, maybe partly
at my encouragement, have looked at me as particularly verbally gifted.
But the origins for me are exactly the opposite. Math and numbers, to a
lesser extent science, all seemed natural to me. Language, however,
seemed beyond me. In time it would seem mystical.</p>
<p>My solution to 7th grade Spanish was to enroll in Latin for 8th grade,
and I would stay with that through high school.</p>

<p>What a year this was and I didn't even recognize it as such at the time.
I remember just "keepin on keepin on." I can remember the classroom as
the notification came round that the President had been shot. I still
identified with my parents' predilections at that point – I had rooted
for Nixon because they had. I felt an inner kind "whoa", which was a
combination of "holy smokes" and "that's kind of cool." I felt guilty
afterwards for feeling an initial kind of elation. It was not unlike the
high that I felt when we had to get down to inspect the flood of
downtown Denver several years later. The class was algebra class, my
homeroom teacher for 8th grade. He made his reputation with us by
requiring students to wear string on their trousers if they forgot to
wear a built. He also made you stand against the wall on your finger
tips for various infractions. And then, finally, he threw chalk at
"talkers" or other problems in the class, hard enough to leave a mark on
the wall. Such things, of course, that wouldn't be tolerated these days.</p>
<p>It would have been about this time that I began to learn to ski. I
remember so clearly the times of skiing down the little hills at the
park across from the Jansen house. There were 2 ponds not far apart.
They often froze and we would skate on them. I just loved the sensation
of skiing and wanted to do more. When was the time that the Jansen's
first took me skiing. I think it would have been Loveland Basin, but I
remember well the slope. In later years I knew it as a simple
intermediate hill that was too easy for me to ever ski unless I had to.
But that first day it seemed like a cliff and I didn't know how I would
ever get down. I did just fine with my stem turns.</p>
<p>This was the year that I exercised my desire to try football. Mother had
kept me out of it all the years of playing in the backyard, playing in
the snowy front yard, etc. So I went out for 8th grade football. And it
was a total bust. The coach put me as a guard. Was it defense or
offense? I can't remember. But I was not cut out to be a guard. It was I
suppose a position he could most safely put a non-performer.</p>
<p>I also took up wrestling. I wasn't any good at basketball. Wrestling
seemed like something I could do. I advanced a little bit through junior
high, competing in a few tournaments. Mostly learning the techniques
that would allow me to beat a much larger opponent in high school gym
class – one of my great physical victories.</p>
<p>This would have also been the year that my mother first went to bat for
me as a counter-cultural kind of figure. At a time when all the other
guys were cutting their hair very short, I wanted to wear my hair long.
I remember it as a Beatles' inspired sort of thing, so maybe it came in
late 8th grade. I sported bangs – that's all. Nothing very radical. But
I was in big doodoo until my mother sent a note or visited the school.
Then I was permitted to continue with my bangs. I don't really know the
details about that that I should. Like the issue of 4th grade and
Shirley and – I don't know what the deal was all about.</p>

<p>Bridget has sought to make fun of me through the years as I had repeated
stories that involved "my friend Don Debacker." So, of course, I stopped
telling the stories and began to resent her when she launched into the
recitation. It seems so like shit that my mother used to do; so I guess
it pushes buttons in me left over from then.</p>
<p>The year 1964 would have been about the time that that friendship began
to be forged. It probably began in band. My walking path to junior high
took my past his house. I think I remember that in the beginning, it
seemed a tad exotic and scary to be visiting his house. It was a long
way away from my house. It was my friend not a connection with my
mother.</p>

<p>I can remember an episode from walking to or from school that I have
repeated even to my kids and others. It illustrates "luck" or having
more skill than one knows. We were throwing stones at things. I was
pretty good at it, in as much as I was pretty good at baseball. In fact
you might even say that I prided myself on my throwing ability –
witness my disappointment years later when I couldn't throw a rock
across the St. Joseph River in South Bend. So it was an innocent
activity, aiming for harmless targets. But then, as a totally
off-the-wall swagger, I pointed to a lamp more than a block away. I
said, "I can hit that lamp." Now in reality I didn't know whether I
could even throw the stone that far, let alone hit something I was
aiming at. But I heaved the stone. And sure enough, I hit that lamp
square in the middle, and we took off running because at that point we
were vandals.</p>
<p>The memory of that calls to mind other things from my baseball period.
My best year, which might have been '63 or '64, I played all the bases
around the infield. I had generally been 2nd base through the seasons.
But this year I played third base because of throwing arm, and then
settled as the team catcher, again because I had the best throw to
second base. At one point at practice we were given 20 pitches and if we
hit each one we wouldn't have to run laps. I was the only one on the
team to hit all 20. The following year of baseball I was a total bust,
had zero hits, was assigned to the outfield, and barely played. I don't
know what happened – but it was a formative experience. I never really
thought of myself as an athlete after that.</p>
<p>One other memory from baseball, however, is another story that I have
often repeated. We were in the home team dugout and at bat. Someone on
the other team, in center field, lost a contact. The game was stopped
and all the help invited to look for the lost contact. I arose from the
bench, walked in a straight line to center field, stopped and looked
down and picked up the contact lens. So extraordinary! And I kind of
just went along with and continued playing the game.</p>
<p>Beginning in 8th grade I had gone out for wrestling. It wasn't exactly
that I did well, but I did tolerably well. I was a successful 2nd string
sort of wrestler. By the 9th grade I knew that I didn't have a future in
that, so wouldn't plan on starting that in high school.</p>
<p>The possible exception to the athlete in me was skiing. That began to
take off at this point, my father paying for us to "keep up with the
Jansen's." [It would be decades later that I would learn that this was
also the time that our father was having an affair with Mrs. Jansen.]
For 2 years we took the train to Winter Park each weekend. How fun was
that! After that we took a bus to Loveland Basin – until my last couple
of years of high school during which I parked cars at Loveland and got
to ski on Saturday and Sunday.</p>
<p>1964 was the year that Barry Goldwater ran for President. It would be
the last year that my father's politics was rubbing off on me. He
supported Goldwater as the conservative reactionary that he always was.
I, however, saw in Goldwater a break with "business as usual." I think
that possibly I was already becoming alarmed about the Vietnam War and
wanted to see it ended. I imagined Goldwater's forcefulness as the best
course for ending it (winning it) soon. I was seeing something different
from my father, and my counter-culture tendencies were beginning to
emerge. I can remember all this in part because of a bicycle trip I
made, downtown, across the 8th Ave. bridge, to a rally where Goldwater
was speaking. I have always remembered it as in a low-lying park of some
kind.</p>

<p>What an epochal year 1968 was. Did we know it was so as we experienced
it? Retrospectives and nostalgia has rehearsed several times that year
in the decades that have ensued.</p>
<p>Perhaps the clearest memory I have of those fateful events was the
killing of Robert Kennedy. Four years before I had ridden my bicycle
downtown in order be present for a gathering of Barry Goldwater. Perhaps
in 1964 I was still influenced by my parents' politics. But I remember
most the sense that Goldwater's policies would bring about change. And I
wanted change. I wanted something to happen. The wishes, I suppose, of
an ordinary adolescent.</p>
<p>But by 1968 I felt myself to be wiser. I had experienced for some time
the sense that the Vietnam War would last forever. Literally. I felt
like it had always been and always would. Such is the perspective of a
teenager. So I was interested in the anti-war energy being fanned in the
Democratic Party. Eugene McCarthy was the one to raise that banner. And
he attracted the white, middle-class, students. But somehow my
sympathies were far deeper for Kennedy who was running not as a
one-issue candidate but as one who sought to reach out to the poor, the
underclass, the blacks (still called negroes? in that day?). Perhaps
again he was one who seemed to promise real change. Perhaps I have had
the heart for the poor and the outcast from an early age.</p>
<p>I think it is related to the steady stream of such type folks that made
their way through our home through the years of my growing up. Spitzy
McFadden, the house-cleaner. The mentally handicapped woman who was a
nanny and house-keeper type in my pre-teen years. My mother's early
investment in nursing home care – the kind of nursing she has always
loved the most. It was for me not a condescending kind of thing. Perhaps
more the natural sympathies that are evoked by the Kennedy clan, even
with (or because of) their considerable wealth.</p>
<p>So Bobby Kennedy was the one I was rapidly building a passion for. Keep
in mind, that in 1968 I was still 3 years away from being able to vote.
That would change in the next years, so that my little brother Billy
would vote in a presidential election the same year I did – 1972. I
slept in the dugout crawl space of our house – the dungeon. I had real
privacy down there, though I never had the bathroom that was provided
for in the roughed out carpentry. I awoke with a prized clock radio. It
had been ordered through National Geographic, I think, as a special
luxury item. Mom had bought it for me. I relied on it because I didn't
get much sunlight through that small sunken window well. I awoke that
day to the sound of a newscaster describing something about a shooting.
It was the morning after the California primary when Bobby Kennedy would
finally make himself the candidate to beat. I knew with a deep
resignation, the start of a pervasive cynicism, that he was the one who
was shot, even without hearing his name for several minutes.</p>
<p>Following graduation from high school, I had received the all-American
message that I had to work. Go out and find a job. My lead came from the
"man" in my mother's life. He had some kind of mechanic sort of job
working for one of the airlines. Somehow, whether by his suggestion or
his recommendation, I ended up applying for a job at Stapleton
International Airport. [Was it already "International"? Or was it still
just "Stapleton Field" in 1968? I don't know.] The work I ended up with
was the lowest of all grunt work. The kind that today goes to the newest
arrivals from Central America. I washed dishes and did some food service
type work for "Sky Chef", the outfit that supplied the food to the
airlines. And it was the graveyard shift, 11pm - 7:30am.</p>
<p>Of course I did well, better than most of the hires that they were
accustomed to. It wasn't easy for me, however, to do such mindless work.
I actually relished the opportunity to go out on the trucks to make
deliveries to the planes – that was some kind of "advancement" and
responsibility. I think I was even allowed to drive a truck on several
occasions.</p>
<p>Two things stick out about that experience. One was that I vowed never
to work the graveyard shift again. But secondly, that work schedule
allowed me to do more things than I would have otherwise. I remember
playing golf on a number of occasions after I got off work in the
morning. The course was empty and it was a significant shift in focus
from the job to be playing at father's country club. Perhaps I also
played public courses, I don't remember.</p>
<p>It must have been during this time that I went out with Dad to buy a
car. He may even have loaned some or all of the $300 dollars I paid for
a 6-7 year old Simca (made in France.) Such a silly car. You had to jam
the gear shift into the radio in order to get it into reverse. On one
occasion I was unable to actually get it in gear, so I just opened the
driver's side door and pushed the car backwards with one foot. It was a
tiny sedan, cream in color. It was off to college I went in that
automobile.</p>

<p>Was it Halloween this year? Sometime around then. Do I still have a
picture of those braids?</p>
<p>Ah, my diary reminded me (10/31/2006) that it is Halloween night. An
event I don't mind missing. But it partially explains the absence of any
calls from the girls. Perhaps B. told them not to call. But Emma is
really focused on the dressing up. Lydia said she is not really going to
observe, I think.</p>
<p>I related to someone the other day, and thus the memory, of the last
time I "observed" the evening. I was thinking of the time on Dudley
street when Mo and I put my braids up with clothes hangers, standing on
end like horns. How silly it was – and weird.</p>

"caught" by Bob McKay, coming to help out while Bridget was there.</p>
<p>In a parenthesis, I learned years after this, from Bridget, that the
several times of playing with sex at the apartment were times that she
didn't enjoy. Once in the bathroom, locking the door, while the children
were outside knocking, asking, "What are you doing in there?" Another
time, in the pool, slipping my hand in her swim suit. Ah, well,</p>

<p>I am writing long after the events. It's good that I made brief notes to
myself years ago or I'd be hard pressed to drag out anything from the
year 1992.</p>
<p>It was the beginning of what would be the first full year of marriage to
Bridget. There was still enthusiasm and hope at the beginning of the
year. We got scheduled to attend Marriage Encounter.</p>
<p>It was probably the McKay's who sponsored us. In later years I learned a
little about their marriage experience and intuited a little bit more.
They were a couple who built their relationship on the two roles that
they played. Marilyn was the saint, the responsible one, the one who did
the right things. Bob was the failure, the screw-up. Later he would
admit to depression and the help that Prozac had for him. I sensed from
an early time an alcoholic-style personality about him. I always
wondered whether that had been a part of their original break-up and
divorce. They were apart for some period of time, then chose to remarry.
There was a part of me throughout our 10 years in Michigan City that
said, "The McKay's did the right thing about marriage. I did the wrong
thing."</p>
<p>I suppose it might have happened with Maureen and me if we hadn't been
intent on remarrying. Both of us were remarried before there was any
kind of rapprochement. It happened at Owen or Julian's high school
graduation. I attended church with them on the Sunday I was there and
Mo's hug with me at the peace indicated a profound kind of
reconciliation. I suppose it meant that she had forgiven me. Several
years earlier I had set about praying for her and found a peace that was
a gift from God. By then, however, Mo and I had chosen other paths than
the one the McKay's chose.</p>
<p>So Bridget and I went to Ft. Wayne for ME. It started out as one would
expect. There was the promise of a deeper intimacy to be shared between
us – at least that's how I interpreted it. It seemed as if Bridget was
going along with it until Saturday night. Something happened. She came
up against a brick wall or something. No longer was there the promise of
something that could grow, but there was a dead-end.</p>
<p>I think it may have been related to a failed pregnancy. I'm thinking
that the bleeding began there. But how could it have been then? It was
something other than the disappointment of pregnancy that alienated us
by Sunday. We were going through the motions. Making a good show. And
that would be the style for years to come.</p>
<p>So we emerged from the weekend battered. And the pattern began
repeating: Bridget suffered and Dale stepped in to do the saving. She
had lost our first effort at having a child, which we both agreed we
wanted. So we set about getting pregnant at the earliest opportunity.
That must have been sometime in March.</p>
<p>There was joy when pregnancy happened. But it didn't really last. Not
unsurprisingly Bridget lost all interest in sex. This would become her
normal pattern, only to be interrupted on a few occasions in the next 14
years. Then she became profoundly jealous over the secretary at the
church. I totally could not understand the source of her feelings
because I knew in myself that there was absolutely nothing there. There
was not even any emotional sharing between us. The closest I could get
would be to think that I trusted her. She had duties and
responsibilities and I trusted that she would carry them out. I wasn't
aware of it at the time, but it's possible that Bridget already
understood that I would eventually be unable to trust her.</p>
<p>Bridget claimed that Cheryl was undermining my ministry at St. Andrew's.
And it's true that some 6 years later Cheryl would in fact be the person
who sabotaged my leadership at the church by her lone vote on the
vestry. I would eventually terminate her on the grounds that the church
could not afford a secretary. But the truth was that I had by then lost
all trust in her. In 1992 it was not that way. I had not yet encountered
a conservative, pentecostal pastor who was at the same time openly
homosexual, along with his readings from the Bible.</p>
<p>I thought that Bridget's reactions to Cheryl were a rather petty
girl-girl thing. And I told her that I thought that it was a matter that
she should resolve with Cheryl, not through me. But Bridget claimed that
I was siding with Cheryl and wouldn't take the side of my wife. The
feelings escalated until August – at least I know it was the later part
of the summer – when she said to me, "I want a divorce." My response to
her was the same as it has been through the years since when she has
repeated the sentiment. I said that if that's what she wanted then she
would have to do it. At least through 2006 she has not acted on that.</p>
<p>I know that I was responding because of the self-critique I made in the
wake of my first marriage. Though Maureen and I had mutually agreed that
we needed to divorce, out of what I thought was chivalry, I volunteered
that I would be the one to file for divorce. That decision was then used
against me repeatedly, with the bishop of Northern Indiana and with our
children that I know of. Mo could act the part of the victim and I was
the persecutor. I came to realize this when I had occasion to remind Mo
that we had mutually agreed to the divorce and she denied it. So I vowed
to myself that I would never do that again.</p>
<p>I was reacting to things that had happened in my first marriage. In this
case that I knew there was nothing – or at least nothing that I could
imagine, and I could imagine quite a few strange and radical scenarios
– that could lead me to file for divorce.</p>
<p>Bridget, at least through 2006, has never acted upon my response. I have
felt that she was unwilling to take responsibility for such a decision.
I have also sensed through the years that she may well be reacting to me
out of past experiences in the same way that I have done it to her. In
2006, during a very emotional encounter in which I was extremely angry
at something she had decided to do, she shot back at me, "Go ahead, hit
me." Now what I knew was that there was not a shred in me that was
inclined to hit her or anything, even though I was so angry I was
shaking. But this encounter, and others like it, have led me to think
that she was responding to me as if I were her first husband, Glendall,
who did hit her.</p>
<p>My notes indicate that it was during this year that I led the church
into buying a digital copier. This purchase ushered in a new level of
publishing capabilities that piqued my predilections for years to come.</p>
<p>The notes also indicate that this summer the 3 children from Colorado
came to stay with us for the full allotted 8 weeks of the divorce
agreement. Soon they would each grow old enough that 8 weeks with Dad in
the summer was not an attractive offer. It may have been in the midst of
the stress that Bridget felt with their presence that the intensity of
her emotions led her to the extremity of saying she wanted a divorce. In
long hind-sight I can see that here she was, getting more and more
pregnant and suddenly she had 3 strangers plopped into the middle of her
life and home. Miriam and Jacob were more or less the same age and there
began a competition in her mind that lasted for a long time afterward.
She saw that I loved my children with an unconditional pasison. She
would later say that I couldn't see the flaws in my children that she
could. This was always in the context of the obvious flaws in her own
son.</p>
<p>1992 would have been his first year in a private school, made possible
by our marriage, wherein he learned to read, as he repeated 3rd grade.
There was the failure of his former school and a learning disability of
some kind. We were not able to really get a firm diagnosis, however,
even as Bridget came to the conclusion that it was ADHD and she trusted
in his use of Ritalin (and substitutes) through the next years. I will
talk about Jacob more at another time.</p>

<p>she is so fearful of touching and then makes the platitude about
"touching". O god help me to accept this sterile relationship. The
self-righteousness sometimes makes me nauseous. She just doesn't get
it. So uncomfortable in her own skin. She carries such heavy burdens
from the past. I am constantly responding to phantoms of some other

<p>5/5/01</p>
<p>Yesterday, Lydia told me after school that her unbroken record,
stretching back to the beginning of 1st grade had been broken. She had
forgotten her homework on Friday. She had done a great job the night
before to finish, without blemish. This kind of inner striving is one of
her great strengths.</p>
<p>This year saw the culmination of many years of quiet witnessing,
together with God's marvelous serendipity. I had had Brian Jakelski as a
student at St. Joseph's College. He wouldn't have withstood the passage
of time in my memory if hadn't been for the fact that I had had to come
to his aid. He got in trouble with the administration and was threatened
with expulsion or suspension. It had to do with drinking and I don't
know what. In effect I was asked to give a character witness sort of
testimony – "he was a diligent student with lots of promise etc. etc."
I think because of the pull of his influential parents he was able to
stay in school and graduate.</p>
<p>Well low and behold he turned up on the scene in Michigan City. He was
the grandson of a stalwart of the parish. (Writing in 2006 I can't
remember her name. She's probably gone by now. She was elderly and quite
frail, living alone in a huge house beside the lake on Lakeshore Dr. She
came down with shingles once. Often wore a back brace. And she
consistently voted in favor of whatever change was needed to attract
young people. Such a sweet spirit.) Well, it turned out that Brian was
devoted to his grandmother and was often at the house watching out for
her.</p>
<p>Brian eventually married and by the time his son was born he had become
an attender at St. Andrew's. David J. &amp; ?? helped to incorporate them in
an oral tradition fellowship group. So we oversaw the baptism and young
Merrick become a favorite of Lydia and Emma. We rode our bikes to their
house several times.</p>

<p>First year at St. Mary's. Honeymoon period. Experiencing the indulgence
of Jan Horimoto.</p>
<p>Computer learnings directed at the preparation of the booklet for the
centennial celebration in December. Using Pagemaker – so glad to be
able to pass a Pagemaker file over to printer. By 2005 the standard had
become pdf files – and since I was using Linux by then, that part was
easy.</p>
<p>Lydia's first year at Kamiloiki included the awesome openness to run for
school office. She was resoundingly defeated. The poignance of her naive
belief in herself inspires me.</p>
<p>Same kind of enthusiasm, that in 2006 I look back on with such
nostalgia, was her desire to play soccer. I was a kind of unofficial
assistant coach in her 2nd season (winter 2003). Later, in 2006, she
confessed to me that she had harbored a dream that she would be chosen
for a "select" team. The coach apologized to me in fall 2005 that he and
his assistant debated choosing Lydia because her spirit, her
coachability, was so strong, but ultimately they felt they couldn't.
Probably much of Lydia's "dream" had been the result of Emma's being so
successful at soccer – so that softens the pang in my heart.</p>

<a id="user-content-2003" class="anchor" href="#2003" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>2003</h2>
<p>It would have been 2003 that Emma would have begun soccer. It wasn't
immediately apparent that Emma was a natural player, but she had
enthusiasm and determination that wouldn't quit. Her 1st season was with
U8. Nobody really knew much about playing soccer – the rules didn't
even call for a goalie at that point. But later she was playing with
girls that had been playing longer than she and had skills that she just
didn't. She took at as a challenge and by her 4th season she had been
chosen for a select team. Then for a HYSA club newly forming in Hawai'i
Kai.</p>
<p>Emma looked at Lydia with such envy. As a parent it becomes apparent
that these 2 girls look at one another and think the other has
everything they don't. Emma ends up saying in 2005 that Lydia is the
perfect child, the perfect student. That she is just stupid. Lydia looks
at Emma as successful at soccer, a champion at making friends, and
seemingly unaffected by the latent depression that Lydia has wrestled
with since moving to Hawai'i.</p>
<p>Lydia's depression and so much more I perceive as an extension of her
identification with Bridget. By 2005 she sits in front of the tv for
hours at a time, just like Bridget. Lydia echoes B's longing for
Indiana. She takes up her arguments against me, even when it doesn't
involve her thinking. e.g. budgetary conflicts in 2006 re. fixing the
2nd car.</p>
<p>This would have been the summer that B. took the girls to Indiana
without me. I had my first experience of the panic of this, left over
from my experience with the older kids. It would be repeated again in</p>

<p>This would be the year that B's mom would die of cancer.</p>
<p>Return for a few hours to St. Andrew's Michigan City.</p>
<p>In the fall Lydia and I began prepping her for entrance into The Priory.
She had to take SSAT. It was good to coach her to exercise teaching
abilities. I think it was about this time that we began having talks at
night as she went to bed. The one thing I remember from those nightly
coaching and talks was the vocabulary word on the first page of the
practice test: "tenacity." I told her that she had tenacity with her
determination to "do what it takes". She applied it to getting into The
Priory. She showed it in her being elected the reconciler of the year
with the group she was with the previous year at Kamiloiki – finding
reconciliation in conflicts on the playground. She understood and
claimed it for herself.</p>
<p>I had become the one to put the girls to bed from Michigan City days. B.
never took it upon herself to practice this great blessing.</p>
<p>While B. was still in Indiana following her mother's death, Emma broke
her nose playing "capture the flag" at school. I was at work when I
received the call from the school nurse. I had left the car at the house
for the Car Doctor to work on. Cal (Christy's grandpa) took Emma to the
clinic in Hawai'i Kai and then on to the church to pick me up as we went
to Kapiolani Hospital for X-rays. Surgery was scheduled after an
appointment with a pediatric plastic surgeon.</p>
<p>I experienced a variation of the agony I had felt with Owen when he got
his ear tubes in Boulder Colorado, summer 1979. I held and hugged Emma
until she was gone, under the anaesthesia – it only took a few moments.
Then the wait. She was so brave in wearing the gaudy bandage on her nose
for the days that followed. It was something a badge of importance, I
guess.</p>
<p>Her story of the game that caused the injury became for the epitome of
Emma's spirit of determination. Two girls got to the "flag" at the same
time and there was no way that Emma was going to let her get it. No
pulling back for her. Instead the other girl's head came roaring up to
smash into Emma's nose.</p>
<p>[I'm listening to Harry Chapin right now and the song "Mr. Tanner" has
been so present for me being a parent. Knowing and seeing that my
children start out with a delightful exuberance and passion that gets
crushed by others along the way. They end up only singing for
"themselves, late at night."]</p>

<p>This was the year in which Lydia and Emma and I went to Miriam's
graduation in Tacoma. Such a beautiful trip.</p>
<p>Later in the summer B. went by herself to Indiana.</p>
<p>Later still we would all travel to Maui for diocesan convention. Writing
in 2006 I am guessing that was our last vacation as a family. The last
time had been the move to Hawai'i – not what B. would call a vacation
in as much as she has repeatedly referred to her agreeing to move her as
a giant concession to me that I should forever after acknowledge.</p>
<p>Visit for a few hours from Bob and Marilyn McKay of St. Andrew's.</p>
<p>Julian was with us for about 10 days in August.</p>
<p>Lydia began school at The Priory.</p>
<p>Emma began playing HYSA with Riggers. First season was in the fall. They
were repeatedly slaughtered by more experienced and skilled teams (e.g.
Chicago Bulls).</p>

<p>I experienced my 2nd year of teaching Bible at Iolani. As my colleague
there said, "the first year is shear hell. The second is just hell." I
didn't really experience it that way. I laughed with all but a couple of
days. I set for myself the goal of creating a slideshow presentation for
every one of my lectures and I met the goal. It seemed to help with the
students and helped with my ability to keep on track and to feel
comfortable with the material.</p>
<p>I had wanted to experiment with the increased use of video teaching
methods and I harped with the students that I wanted creativity in their
presentations. Finally, towards the end, one of the students submitted a
video collage on "Greek philosophy." It was masterful, and as my
colleague observed, was probably easy for him to produce. Nevertheless
my own victory was in being able to elicit that kind of work from the
students.</p>
<p>I have written in <em>The Angelus</em> about this experience.</p>
<p>Later, I culminated a year of working with the Search Committee of the
diocese by accompanying our candidates on our "fly-about"of the diocese.
I got to visit Molok'ai for the first time.</p>
