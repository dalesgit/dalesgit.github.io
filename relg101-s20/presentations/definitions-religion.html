A North American touring the highlands of New Guinea for a visit to one of the tribes living in the outback might well witness men decorated in bird-of-paradise feathers, nude (save for a penis sheath), covered in ashes, and dancing before a fire at the side of which are pigs bound in vines and banana leaves. His or her first reaction might well be to take some photographs in order to show “the folks back home” some  of the exotic aspects of life among primitive peoples. But this picture can be reversed.

<p>
Suppose the tribesmen of the outback visit a downtown church on Sunday morning. They observe rows of oddly dressed people (what, after all, is the purpose of a necktie?), notice that some sit while others sing, listen to one person speak at length, and see still others pass plates onto which paper and metal disks are placed. What are these tribesmen to think? Where, after all, are the pigs? The fire? The sacred feathers? In both cases, the observer lacks a sense of perspective and context.

The lesson is a simple one. It is impossible to get at the intention that lies behind religious behavior unless we have a willingness to <b>enter sympathetically into the cultural worldview of another person</b>, at least for a moment.

November 21, 1768 – February 12, 1834) was a German theologian, philosopher, and biblical scholar known for his attempt to reconcile the criticisms of the Enlightenment with traditional Protestant Christianity. He also became influential in the evolution of Higher Criticism, and his work forms part of the foundation of the modern field of hermeneutics. Because of his profound effect on subsequent Christian thought, he is often called the "Father of Modern Liberal Theology" and is considered an early leader in liberal Christianity. The Neo-Orthodoxy movement of the twentieth century, typically (though not without challenge) seen to be spearheaded by Karl Barth, was in many ways an attempt to challenge his influence.

<p>
The nineteenth-century German thinker Karl Marx, the founder and primary theorist of Marxism, had an antithetical and complex attitude to religion,[1] viewing it primarily as "the soul of soulless conditions", the "opium of the people" that had been useful to the ruling classes since it gave the working classes false hope for millennia. At the same time Marx saw religion as a form of protest by the working classes against their poor economic conditions and their alienation.[2]

</p>

<p>
Sigmund Freud's views on religion are described in several of his books and essays. Freud regarded God as an illusion, based on the infantile need for a powerful father figure; religion, necessary to help us restrain violent impulses earlier in the development of civilization, can now be set aside in favor of reason and science.[1]

<li><b>cautious, recognizing that we cannot escape our own perspective</b> &#x2026;</li>

<li>is this an essential <b>western / rationalistic</b> effort to <b>define</b> religion?</li>

<li>it may also be a result of influence of <b>Judeo-Christian</b> tradition</li>

<li><p>
it may be result of <b>dualistic</b> thinking &#x2013; (either/or)
</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
The very attempt to define religion, to find some distinctive or possibly unique essence or set of qualities that distinguish the "religious" from the remainder of human life, is primarily a Western concern. The attempt is a natural consequence of the Western speculative, intellectualistic, and scientific disposition. It is also the product of the dominant Western religious mode, what is called the Judeo-Christian climate or, more accurately, the theistic inheritance from Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. 
</p>


<p>
The theistic form of belief in this tradition, even when downgraded culturally, is formative of the dichotomous Western view of religion. That is, the basic structure of theism is essentially a distinction between a transcendent deity and all else, between the creator and his creation, between God and man.

<h3 id="org3502508">Religion and Human Thought</h3>
<p>
Religion is intimately connected with human thought.
</p>

<p>
Even those who focus on practice have beliefs, develop doctrines, and emphasize the importance of certain teachings in the religious life essential to their way of life.
</p>




</section>
<section id="slide-org78069b3">
<h3 id="org78069b3">Religion and Feeling</h3>
<p>
To some extent, all religious experience is an emotional experience.
</p>

<p>
Friedrich Schleiermacher characterized religion as a <b>feeling of absolute dependence</b>. 
</p>

<p>
Rudolf Otto, characterized religion as the <b>experience of the holy</b>. And this experience is one that inspires feelings of <b>fear, awe, terror, and love</b>. 
</p>




</section>
<section id="slide-orgaf0aaaa">
<h3 id="orgaf0aaaa">Religion and Action</h3>
<p>
Clearly <b>action</b> is an essential component of any religion.  Examples of include:
</p>

<ol>
<li class="fragment appear">Islam = the duty of prayer and <b>salat</b></li>
<li class="fragment appear">Shinto = approach the shrine of kami by washing, ringing a bell, and clapping their hands</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Roman Catholicism =  attend mass</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Methodism = outer holiness, inner holiness, spreading holiness</li>

</ol>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
While the form and place of religious action vary, the importance of action to an understanding of religion is evident.
</p>

</aside>

<section id="slide-org9a4f675">
<h3 id="org9a4f675">Individual and Social Existence</h3>
<p>
In religion there is an essential tension between the <b>individual</b> and <b>the community</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">One of the most elementary components of religion is some emphasis on the idea of society.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Thus, the essence of religion is the ways in which it enables individual persons to identify with the values associated with a particular group.</li>

</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Most of the great religions make a place for <b>individual devotion</b> and encourage persons to search for <b>union with the ultimate reality</b>.
</p>

<p>
But we must be careful not to overstress the individual dimension of religion.
</p>

</aside>
</section>
<section id="slide-orga957fa4">
<h3 id="orga957fa4">Values and Religion</h3>
<p>
In most times and places, religion and morality are intertwined  
</p>
<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">religion may confirm moral law</li>
<li class="fragment appear">religion may give one power to perform one's duty</li>
<li class="fragment appear">religion may express society's values</li>

</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>

</p>

<p>
In most times and places, religion has been closely connected with morality.
</p>
<ul>
<li>To some, religion confirms the moral law and gives one power to perform one's duty.</li>
<li>Religion is a way of expressing important societal values.</li>
<li>For example, when believers in various settings pray or offer sacrifices to honor God, or to ward off spirits that threaten tribal unity, they express their sense of what is important in life.</li>
