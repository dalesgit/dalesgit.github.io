The most important part of your grade will be based on thinking about the issues of religion. You will be expected to use what we read, what we talk about, what is presented.

On sheet of paper write your name. Then write down:

<ul>
<li>What you would like to learn in this class</li>
<li>What is something that interests you but you don't know very much about (not necessarily religious in nature)</li>
<li>if there is anything the instructor should know about you with regard to this class</li>

<li>Write down a significant experience that you would characterize as <b>religious</b> and that you would be willing to briefly share with the class.</li>

<li class="fragment appear">Write down a significant that you would <b>not characterize as a religious experience</b></li>

<li>In this class we will be trying to understand the distinction between these two things. How do we tell? What kinds of characteristics are we looking for?</li>

<li>Goal: to open our understanding of the immense diversity of religion</li>
<li>We will touch on intense, deeply significant events &#x2013; have charity to one another, and to yourselves. <b>Respect</b></li>

<ul>
<li>Humanistic. Approach: broad historical and cultural understanding of religion</li>

<ul>
<li>You probably bring an expectation of religious study as related to church. You may seek answers to questions we will wrestle with from your church tradition or pastor. May or may not be helpful.</li>
<li>My own conviction is that there is a direct connection between study of religion and each of your disciplines (major) at WU</li>

<li>What connections with your own experience and learning can you make?</li>
