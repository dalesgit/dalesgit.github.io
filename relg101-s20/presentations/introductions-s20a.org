The most important part of your grade will be based on thinking about the issues of religion. You will be expected to use what we read, what we talk about, what is presented.

*** Significant Experience
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: significant-experience
    :END:

 - Write down a significant experience that you would characterize as *religious* and that you would be willing to briefly share with the class.
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
 - Write down a significant that you would *not characterize as a religious experience*
 - Share with someone your experiences and discuss the question, “What makes one ****religious**** and the other not?”
#+begin_notes
- In this class we will be trying to understand the distinction between these two things. How do we tell? What kinds of characteristics are we looking for?
- Not looking to decide a *right or wrong* answer

** Religious Experience covers a vast range
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: religious-experience-covers-a-vast-range
   :END:

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Breadth of Religious Experience
- Religion touches on almost all human experience and culture
- Religion is incredibly diverse, varied, plural
- Religion affects the depths of human heart, motivation, direction, purpose in life.
#+begin_notes
- Not limited by church -- we'll see not even limited by God
- My own conviction that it is in the *ordinary* that one experiences Grace. cf. Jewish prescription for blessings associated with the most mundane and homely actions
- Goal: to open our understanding of the immense diversity of religion
- We will touch on intense, deeply significant events -- have charity to one another, and to yourselves. *Respect*

*** Two Fundamental Approaches to the Study of Religion
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: two-fundamental-approaches-to-the-study-of-religion
    :END:

- Humanistic. Approach: broad historical and cultural understanding of religion
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Theological. Approach: understanding and developing a particular religious tradition and its faith
- **We will be following the first approach**
#+begin_notes
- You probably bring an expectation of religious study as related to church. You may seek answers to questions we will wrestle with from your church tradition or pastor. May or may not be helpful.
- My own conviction is that there is a direct connection between study of religion and each of your disciplines (major) at WU
