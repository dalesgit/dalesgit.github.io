</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Confucianism">Encyc Britt</a>
Confucianism, a Western term that has no counterpart in Chinese, is a worldview, a social ethic, a political ideology, a scholarly tradition, and a way of life. Sometimes viewed as a philosophy and sometimes as a religion, Confucianism may be understood as an all-encompassing way of thinking and living that entails ancestor reverence and a profound human-centred religiousness. East Asians may profess themselves to be Shintōists, Daoists, Buddhists, Muslims, or Christians, but, by announcing their religious affiliations, seldom do they cease to be Confucians.
</p>

<p>
Confucian ethical values have for well over 2,000 years served as the source of inspiration as well as the court of appeal for human interaction between individuals, communities, and nations in the Sinitic world.

<p>
3 legged stool:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Respect for one's parents, filial piety, is considered the most fundamental of the Confucian values, the root of all others.</li>
<li>Another key value in Confucian thinking&#x2013;the second leg of the tripod&#x2013;is humaneness, the care and concern for other human beings.</li>
<li>The last of the three central Confucian values is respect for ritual&#x2013;the proper way of doing things in the deepest sense</li>

<h3 id="org63bd46f">3 Ways of Hinduism</h3>
<ul>
<li>Over time there developed 3 paths to <b>moksha</b>

<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">Way of action</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Way of wisdom</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Way of devotion</li>

</ul></li>

</ul>


<aside class="notes">
<p>
The ultimate goal of Hinduism is freedom from samsara. Classical Hinduism establish the basic problem of life as escaping the cycle. Moksha.  There are three traditional ways to do this in Hinduism.
</p>

<p>
The first is the way of action. The things that one does in life such as rituals, pilgrimage, are done in order to achieve moksha. There are three goods in life, duty, wealth, pleasure, and Mockshire. The first three must be given up in order to gain the fourth. All of these interact to fulfill one’s karma. Karma has to do with actions and its consequences. It is a principle of justice and it is what binds a soul to samsara. 
</p>

<p>
Second is the way of wisdom. The way of wisdom is reflected in the texts of the Upanishads. This dates from the axial age. The principle of the unity of Brahman and Atman is foundational theory for the path of wisdom. Braman is the power of all powers and is chiefly understood through negative theology, identifying what it is not. Atman came to be the word for soul. It is imperceptible, spiritual, beyond comprehension, immortal.
</p>

<p>
Third is the way of devotion. Hinduism embraces both polytheism and monotheism. This approach focuses ones love on a personal deity. This allows different people to focus on different gods and us different paths.
</p>

<p>
Into this developing Hinduism came a reformer by the Gautama.

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<ul>
<li>During its 2,500-year history, from the time of the Buddha to the
present day, Buddhism has grown from a tiny religious community in
northern India into a movement that now spans the globe.</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">the tradition begins simply with a <b>human being &#x2013; Siddhartha
Gautama</b> who found a solution to the problem of human suffering.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Buddhists focus on his experience, and they <b>deny the existence of a
single, almighty God.</b></li>
<li class="fragment appear">The most basic Buddhist expression of faith is called the triple
refuge:</li>

</ul>

<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">I take refuge in the <b>Buddha</b>;</li>
<li class="fragment appear">I take refuge in the <b>Dharma</b> [ <i>the Buddhas teaching</i> ];</li>
<li class="fragment appear">I take refuge in the <b>Samgha</b> [ <i>the community of the Buddhas
followers</i> ].</li>

</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Note: The Buddhist tradition will challenge us to look in new ways at
some basic religious questions: What is ultimate reality? How can I know
it? And does it love me? Many religious traditions emphasize the
importance of an immortal soul. This is not so in Buddhism.

<ul>
<li>The doctrine of reincarnation or rebirth is known as <b>samsara</b>
(literally, <i>wandering</i>). Samsara was not considered a pleasant
prospect. For many people, it was not an opportunity as much as it
was a burden, and they tried to find a way out.</li>
<li>The release from <b>samsara</b> is found in <b>moksha</b></li>
<li>Four Noble Truths are:</li>

</ul>
<ol>
<li class="fragment appear">the truth of suffering (<b>Gurkha</b>): <i>all is suffering</i></li>
<li class="fragment appear">the truth of the arising of suffering: <i>it is from desire</i></li>
<li class="fragment appear">the truth of the cessation of suffering (also known as <b>nirvana</b> or
<b>nibbana</b>): <i>i.e. cease from desire</i></li>
<li class="fragment appear">the truth of the path that leads to the cessation of suffering: <i>via
8-fold path</i></li>

</ol>

<p>
Note: Buddhists have a rich tradition of stories and legends about the
Buddha. The stories begin with the Buddhas previous lives. Buddhist
tradition arose at a time when the doctrine of reincarnation was a basic
assumption in Indian religious life.
