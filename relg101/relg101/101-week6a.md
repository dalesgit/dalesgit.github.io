## Introduction

-   During its 2,500-year history, from the time of the Buddha to the present day, Buddhism has grown from a tiny religious community in northern India into a movement that now spans the globe.

-   the tradition begins simply with a **human being – Siddhartha Gautama** who found a solution to the problem of human suffering. 
-   Buddhists focus on his experience, and they **deny the existence of a single, almighty God.** 

--

-   The most basic Buddhist expression of faith is called the triple refuge: 
	-   I take refuge in the **Buddha**; 
	-   I take refuge in the **Dharma** [*the Buddhas teaching*]; 
	-   I take refuge in the **Samgha** [*the community of the Buddhas followers*].

Note:
The Buddhist tradition will challenge us to look in new ways at some basic religious questions: What is ultimate reality? How can I know it? And does it love me? Many religious traditions emphasize the importance of an immortal soul. This is not so in Buddhism.

## Buddha

- The doctrine of reincarnation or rebirth is known as **samsara** (literally, *wandering*). Samsara was not considered a pleasant prospect. For many people, it was not an opportunity as much as it was a burden, and they tried to find a way out.
- The release from **samsara**  is found in **moksha**

-   Four Noble Truths are: 
    
    1.  the truth of suffering (**Gurkha**): *all is suffering*
    
    2.  the truth of the arising of suffering: *it is from desire*
    
    3.  the truth of the cessation of suffering (also known as **nirvana** or **nibbana**): *i.e. cease from desire*
    
    4.  the truth of the path that leads to the cessation of suffering: *via 8-fold path*
Note:
Buddhists have a rich tradition of stories and legends about the Buddha. The stories begin with the Buddhas previous lives. Buddhist tradition arose at a time when the doctrine of reincarnation was a basic assumption in Indian religious life.

## The path to nirvana is divided into eight categories:

-   right understanding,

-   right thought,

-   right speech,

-   right action,

-   right livelihood,

-   right effort,

-   right mindfulness,

-   right concentration.

**The logic might be expressed in 3 categories:**

-   **sila**, or moral conduct; 
-   **samadhi**, or mental concentration; and 
-   **pa-a**, or wisdom

- **emptiness**: Hinduism there is an eternal self. Buddhism there is &ldquo;no-self&rdquo;

##  Chinese adoption of Buddhism blended with an adaptation of Chinese Taoism
    
 The Tao that can be told of is not the eternal Tao; 
 The name that can be named is not the eternal name. 
 The Nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth; 
 The Named is the mother of all things.  
 The Tao is empty like a bowl.  
 It may be used but its capacity is never exhausted.

---


## 1-2<a id="sec-3-1" name="sec-3-1"></a>

- **Overcoming the Monster** — Stories like Beowulf, ‘Little Red Riding Hood’, Jaws, and many of the James Bond films, where a hero must defeat a monster and restore order to a world that has been threatened by the monster’s presence.
- **Rags to Riches** — These stories feature modest, generally virtuous but downtrodden characters, who achieve a happy ending when their special talents or true beauty is revealed to the world at large. Includes any number of classics such as ‘Cinderella’, David Copperfield, and the Horatio Alger novels.

---


## 3-4<a id="sec-3-2" name="sec-3-2"></a>

- **The Quest** — A hero, often accompanied by sidekicks, travels in search of a priceless treasure and fights against evil and overpowering odds, and ends when he gets both the treasure and the girl. The Odyssey is a classic example of this kind of story.
- **Voyage and Return** — Alice in Wonderland, Robinson Crusoe on his desert island, other stories of normal protagonists who are suddenly thrust into strange and alien worlds and must make their way back to normal life once more.

---


## 5-7<a id="sec-3-3" name="sec-3-3"></a>

- **Comedy** — Not always synonymous with humour. Instead, the plot of a comedy involves some kind of confusion that must be resolved before the hero and heroine can be united in love. Think of Shakespeare’s comedies, The Marriage of Figaro, the plays of Oscar Wilde and Gilbert and Sullivan, and even War and Peace.
- **Tragedy** — As a rule, the terrible consequences of human overreaching and egotism. The Picture of Dorian Gray, Julius Caesar, Anna Karenina…this category is usually self-evident.
- **Rebirth** — The stories of Ebeneezer Scrooge and Mary Lennox would fall into this basic plot type, which focuses on a threatening shadow that seems nearly victorious until a sequence of fortuitous (or even miraculous) events lead to redemption and rebirth, and the restoration of a happier world.
