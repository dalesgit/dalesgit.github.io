## special Highlights

- film and the Bible
- 'apiru
- sacred places
- redaction criticism
- Liberation Theology

Note:
Redaction is the other part of source criticism. Putting it together, why the way it came together? Liberation theology sees in Exodus the expression of what God does, I.e. opposes all oppression, sides with the oppressed. But "one group's liberation is another's oppression."

## Perception of the character of YHWH

- a warrior God?
- abusing & manipulating? e.g. the Egyptians
- performer of magic?
- with re. women?

Note:
Exodus is the formative narrative the way Jesus' Passion is for Christians. Telling the story would have been done in ancient Israel.

- humor and irony of the story of Moses' birth requires knowledge of the context of what is expected of kings
- patriarchal societies; sub-theme of important role of women

Note:
Can we see the parody?
