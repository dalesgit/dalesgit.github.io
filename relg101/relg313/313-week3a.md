# questions from ch. 1

[timeline](http://prezi.com/z0amb_jvtndc/?utm_campaign=share&utm_medium=copy&rc=ex0share)
--

## "tribal religion" (cultural setting)

The one question I had was about the tribal religion. I know that, that is a small section but what the author was trying to get across just flew over my head. Everything else made sense, it was just that one part that confused me, so clarification on that would be wonderful.

--

## nomadic life (cultural setting)

One thing that slightly confused me was that the beginning of the reading discussed nomadic, and semi-nomadic life. The book says "nomadic groups defined who they were, not by where they lived, since this changed, but by family descent" Then later, a large portion discusses landownership and other requirements for citizenship.  It confuses me because at first, thinking of nomadic life, I would think there would be no citizenship if there is no established nation, and also no landownership since where they were living was ever-changing. I am curious about the transition from nomadic life to land-owning life. Also curios as to the idea citizenship presented here. When exactcly in the storyline did the descendants of Abraham form into a unified nation/group which would have citizenship?

--

## purpose of the "stories"

My one question is how the people of Israel used these stories in their everyday life. It says that they would be like our stories of Thanksgiving, but is it just about where they come from or is it ideal too? Or does that only come later? How did the different tribes treat each other? What about the ones on the outside? How were they treated?

--

## "sacred" places, mountains, etc.

In one of the gray boxed sections, Carvalho reveals that certain land structures (mountains, springs, cities) had a sacred significance to the Israelites. I would like to learn more about the meanings behind these structures as well as what other structures had a religious connotation.

--

## (household gods & others?)

On page 37 it says, "&#x2026;household gods, symbols of the god(s) that the family worshiped". Reading this, it makes me think that this is a sacrilegious act. I know in the text it mentioned that they believed in other gods at the time, but they worshiped Yahweh only. Wouldn't worshiping even a symbol or object of the god(s) be considered sacrilegious?

--

## other cultures

I would be interested in learning more about how early Judaism was influenced by other cultures such as the Babylonian and Canaanite ones. Creation stories in Genesis were inspired by Jews in exile in Babylon, so what other ideas could they have possibly adapted and taken back with them?

--

## angels

I would like to learn more about the writers or authors of Genesis, the book says that there are more than one but who? and how many are there? Another question that this chapter leaves me with is the whole topic of angels, it has a few sentences but doesn't answer and questions only raises more. They don't give a definition of what they are only suggestions of what they could be interpreted as.

--

## other gods

What other gods were worshiped alongside or in place of the God we know from the Bible? How and when was the worship replaced or strayed from? What did the other tribes that worshiped differently think of their counterparts? What were God's feelings towards the presence of servants and concubines within the tribes? An interesting thought there.

--

## other gods --; original audience?

I'm fascinated that Israelite culture recognized the existence of other deities, but that modern Christianity (obviously rooted in the same faith) does not recognize other deities (or even other religious ideas generally speaking.) I'd like to know more about Israelite views on other cultures and religions, and also to read more about the names of God--; I think that much meaning can be gleaned from knowing which name was used (and why.) I am also interested to know more about what was the basis of knowledge for those who the text was originally documented for&#x2014; the author notes that the lives of the patriarchs and matriarchs are noted as old and outdated and their religious practices were as well. I'd like to know more about how historically the initial audience viewed these stories--; I'd also like to know how literal they felt they were.

--

## lack of historical knowledge

I was surprised at how there was such a lack of knowledge about the actual time period of Abraham and his decedents on this Earth. If they, Abraham and Sarah, were the first patriarch and matriarch then that raises the question of where on the timeline of the worlds gradual evolving would they be?

--

## historical evidence

Carvalho does a great job in flipping from a religious perspective and historian perspective when trying to explain why their may be lack of evidence or information. For example, some of the wars can not be traced with records but Carvalho mention how battles lost would not go on record since rulers would not like to track their loss but not looking at the stories through a historian perspective the main point would not being able to prove if events happened but the lesson that can be taught by them. My question surrounds the lack of evidence and information. Would much of the bible, its stories and influence, change if there were more evidence as far as battles lost and dates?

--

## covenant

Although this pertains to the last bit of Genesis, it slightly relates to Exodus. God mentions a covenant with many people through these two books. This convenient, is it ever changing or is it the same covenant that was mentioned in chapter 15? The covenant is stated repeatedly throughout the ending of Genesis and continues into Exodus. If this is the same covenant, then why has it not changed from person to person? What makes this covenant so prominent? Is the Mosaic covenant mentioned in Exodus the same as the other covenants? What makes this one different if it is?

--

## nature of God

How many other times in the Bible do the Israelites show God as their warrior and literal savior from greater peoples? I know that there are many different stories that seem horrific or terrible, because The Old Testament is filled with a violent scary God. So I wonder if it is because I am coming from a place of power and privilege, and not from a place of suppression. Or is this a rare occurrence and the other stories have different reasons from showing God as a merciless killer?

--

## nature of God

For me the issue raised is how can God remain just while killing innocent babies to let force the Egyptians to let the Hebrews go free.

--

## nature of God

"Why are some people God's chosen&#x2026; Why is God okay with killing Egyptian children? Why is God okay with displacement of the Canaanites? 

I am also interested in the changing nature of God&#x2026; I think of God as ""constant"", but if I really look at scripture that idea is not so. Is the warrior God of Exodus the same God who'd send his son to die for the sins of humanity? I have trouble syncing both ideas. I see the human influence on God's character greatly--; do we just twist God to suit our needs as time passes? (the lowly oppressed Hebrews needed a warrior God, comfortable Americans need a God who sends ""blessings"" and justifies their judgment of others?)"

## "heightened" language

The question that arose when reading this chapter is on page 72, fourth paragraph. It talks about the author using mythic elements to heighten the importance of these events. Exactly how much truth is heighten, and how much heighten from the truth? What is the truth? Did God , or author, give us what we want or needed to survive down here on earth; live righteous. These questions I will pursue.
