## Overview of events

Note:
Read from opening of chapter.

---

## Israel in the Wilderness 

-   Exodus 2 parts
-  liminal (threshold) 


Note:
cf. note in Jewish Bible on Ex 19-24 re complexity of the text

---

## Tradition criticism 


-   law at Sinai originally a separate "tradition" from exodus
-   3 different texts; how do they differ **Ex 12:13**; **Nu 28:16-25**; **Dt 16:1-8**

---

## Wilderness narrative spans 4 books


-   Exodus
-   Leviticus
-   Numbers
-   Deuteronomy

Note:
Exodus re. Sinai, build etc. p. 91 (**read**)

---

## Law: Nomos: Torah

-   Law codes a "religious vision of a perfect society" (p. 93)
    -   Covenant (*Exodus 21-23*)
    -   Deuteronomic (*Deut 12-26*)
    -   Holiness (*Leviticus 17-26*)

Note:
Carvalho's notes: Covenant code: rural economy. Dt code: urban based monarchy. Holiness: law-code for priests (then everybody?)

--

## 10 c's (words)

- Ex 20:2-17 & Dt 5:6-21
-   2 kinds of laws:
    -   if/then (*conditional*) (**casuistic**)
    -   do/don't do (*unconditional*) (**apodictic**)

Note:
Cf. a discussion of which of these are embodied in law as we know it?

## Development of the law

Consider someone reading the Constitution in 3,000 years

--------------------------

*The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each State, chosen by the Legislature thereof, for six Years; and each Senator shall have one Vote.*

----------------------------

*The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each State, elected by the people thereof, for six years; and each Senator shall have one vote.*

Note:
cf. where may Israelites offer sacrifice: Ex 20:24 & Dt 12:13-14. How are slave owners to treat male and female slaves: Ex 21:2-11 & Dt 15:12-17. What are th eoptions of the father and the male seducer if an unmarried woman is seduced?: Ex 22:16-17 & Dt 22:28-29.

## Ritual laws in Pentateuch


-   sacrifice "offering" to God as "sumptuous meal"
-   purity laws "capacity to attain holiness"
