The Final Project
============
<small>#HIST3907b, Carleton University</small>



# Goals for this project
+ You will demonstrate via your project mastery of the six modules in this course
+ _ie, you conceive, create, document, a work of digital history that *visualizes* some argument about the past_


# The final form
+ could be an infographic ([picktochart, for instance](http://piktochart.com/))
+ could be online
+ could be a poster for printing
+ ... key thing: the form serves the function!


# Options
1. The Migrant Experience at Home: the Colonial Newspapers Database
2. The Business History of Ottawa: advertisements, etc
3. A topic of your own devising *cleared with me by January 14*


## Working with newspapers
_I will expect to see the following:_

1. searching digitized newspapers for materials appropriate for the larger research project
2. transcribing and encoding these materials in xml (with all of the reflective decision making that entails)


## Working with other materials

1. creation of a dataset with appropriate encoding


## All datasets:

You will share these materials via contributions to the course repository on Github (no later than March 1st)

1. Fork the 'final project' repository https://github.com/hist3907b-winter2015/finalproject
2. Create a folder inside that one, with your name
3. Place a copy of your dataset there.
4. Make a pull request to me to incorporate your dataset into the repo.  


### Your main analytical tool must serve the research question!

+ but remember that exploration & deformation are valid too
+ use your online notebooks to keep track of *what* you are doing and *why*


You will draw on your online notebook for your paradata document.

+ if everything goes pearshape, we can use your notebook to craft a post-mortem: this, too, is productive!



### Some Examples of Interesting Digital History Visualizations

+ [Quantifying Kissinger](http://blog.quantifyingkissinger.com/)
+ [Six Degrees of Francis Bacon](http://sixdegreesoffrancisbacon.com/)
+ [Networks of Commemoration](http://figshare.com/articles/Networks_of_Commemoration_Gender_Class_and_the_Remembrance_of_General_Brock_1898_1912/710956)


+ [Geography of the Post](http://cameronblevins.org/gotp/)
+ [Mapping the Freedmen's Bureau](http://mappingthefreedmensbureau.com/)
+ [Mental Maps of Texts](http://dclure.org/essays/mental-maps-of-texts/)


# Pause. Consider.
Take a quick glance at one of those projects. What strikes you immediately?


# Building as a way of knowing
Many projects make their materials available via github, ex:

+ David McClure, [Textplot](https://github.com/davidmcclure/textplot)
+ ANP455, MSU, Fall 2014 [Digital Atlas of Ancient Egypt](https://github.com/matrix-msu/daea)



## It is not necessary to reinvent the wheel!



# An Introduction to Project Management

_see [DevDH](http://devdh.org) for helpful tutorials_

## The components of a project:
1. the question, problem, or provocation
2. sources (primary, secondary)
3. analytical activity
4. audience
5. product


## Your first checkpoint 
Will respond to these five points.

It will also contain a workplan

See Appleford, Simon, and Jennifer Guiliano. 'Building Your First Work Plan.' DevDH.org, 2013. http://devdh.org/lectures/manageproject/workplan/.


## Planning your time
1. How many hours, total, do you think you have this term?
2. Look at the modules for this course. Which parts do you think will be hardest for you?


The modules correspond to the various steps in working with data. Build into your plan time to learn the tool you think you're most likely going to use.



# Colonial Newspaper Database
https://github.com/hist3907b-winter2015/Colonial-Newspaper-Database

A project of [Melodee Beals, Sheffield Hallam University](http://mhbeals.com/colonial-news-database/)

Read: [Losing my methodology](http://mhbeals.com/losing-my-methodology-revisiting-the-workflow/)


Let's explore the database now, and talk about how we could

1. contribute to it
2. ask interesting questions with it
3. see how it's constructed (we'll get into xml in more depth later)



# Start exploring digital history projects now

and start imagining what you could do...
