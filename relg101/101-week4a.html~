</p>

<p>
##  The Appearance of the Sacred
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The appearance of the sacred is technically called a hierophany, from the two Greek words that mean &ldquo;to reveal the sacred.&rdquo;
</li>
<li>The &ldquo;appearance of the sacred&rdquo; can be understood as the ways in which the sacred is made manifest in the world of human experience.
</li>
<li>Examples:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The Angel who appeared to Muhammad
</li>
<li>The Enlightenment of the Buddha
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
##  Categorizing Manifestations of the Sacred
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Patterns of Sacred Appearances
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Prophetic
</li>
<li>Sacramental
</li>
<li>Mystical
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sacred Media
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Characterizes hierophanies according to the particular vehicle of a sacred appearance.
</li>
<li>Sacred media might include sacred persons, objects, time, and space.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>
&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
##  Prophetic Sacred Appearances
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Identified primarily with Judaism and Islam.
</li>
<li>Focuses on a person (the prophet) who receives a revelation that deals in various ways with historical events in the life of a community.
</li>
<li>The prophet is the &ldquo;sacred media&rdquo;.
</li>
<li>The revelation is one of the patterns of sacred phenomema.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
&#x2013;
</p>

<p>
##  Sacramental Sacred Appearances
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Most apparent in certain forms of Christianity,  Shinto, and various tribal religions.
</li>
<li>Emphasizes the presence of the sacred through aspects of material reality.
</li>
<li>Stresses the role of priests or shamans in the community.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
&#x2013;
</p>

<p>
##  Mystical Sacred Appearances
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Is most characteristic of Buddhism and Hinduism.
</li>
<li>However, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam also manifest mystical traditions.
</li>
<li>Focuses on the importance of a certain state of being or consciousness in the quest for enlightenment or union with the sacred.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
##  Sacred Persons
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The association of the sacred with certain persons is a characteristic of numerous religious traditions.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Sacred persons are most obviously found in those religious traditions whose history points to a &ldquo;founder&rdquo; or great figure at the beginning of the tradition.
</li>
<li>Moses, Jesus, Muhammad, the Buddha, Confucius, and Lao-tzu are famous examples of sacred persons who were also &ldquo;founders&rdquo; of religious traditions.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>
&#x2013;
</p>

<p>
##  Moses (Prophetic Pattern)
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The great prophet of Judaism.
</li>
<li>In Hebrew, a prophet is one who speaks with the authority of another (i.e. God).
</li>
<li>Moses&rsquo; connection with sacred reality is, in one sense, the point of many of the stories told in the biblical books of Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In the biblical stories, Moses&rsquo; primary role is as a spokesman, that is, a prophet, for the &ldquo;Holy One of Israel.&rdquo;
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>
&#x2013;
</p>

<p>
##. Moses
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Moses is sacred as a spokesman for God.
</li>
<li>He brings to the people of Israel the Torah or instruction he receives from God.
</li>
<li>He receives from God not only the written Torah of the various biblical commandments but also the oral Torah by which to interpret these commandments.
</li>
<li>In the end, Moses is regarded as the best of all humanity.
</li>

<li>Buddha (Mystical Pattern)

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The Buddha is sacred as the teacher of the truth about human existence.
</li>
<li>The Buddha is also sacred as the sage who, having attained enlightenment, is able to guide others to the experience of Nirvana.
</li>
<li>Like Moses, the Buddha has a message to proclaim. But the message of the Buddha is not the &ldquo;instruction&rdquo; of God.
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Buddha

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The &ldquo;message&rdquo; of the Buddha is the insight of a master of meditation into the essential nature of all things.
</li>
<li>As a &ldquo;sage,&rdquo; he speaks with the authority gained from his personal acquisition of wisdom.
</li>
<li>Thus, the Buddha grasps something that is, for most, &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; (the root meaning of &ldquo;mystic&rdquo;) and brings it forth.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>
&#x2013;
</p>

<p>
##. Buddha
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The Buddha gives his life to the teaching of his doctrine, known as &ldquo;dharma.&rdquo;
</li>
<li>This dharma teaches that the way to enlightenment is a &ldquo;middle way,&rdquo; a way given neither to sumptuous living nor to extravagant self-discipline, but to the contemplation of the Four Noble Truths.
</li>
<li>Ultimately, the Buddha&rsquo;s connection with the sacred has to do with this dharma&amp;#x2013;or the wisdom that he is able to impart to seekers of the truth.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
&#x2013;
</p>

<p>
##. Buddha
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The Buddha teaches anyone willing to listen, and he has useful advice to offer, no matter how far short one is of the ultimate goal.
</li>
<li>For those ready to renounce all in pursuit of Nirvana, the Buddha holds out participation in the sangha or order of monks and nuns.
</li>
<li>For those less far along, he offers basic spiritual practice, including the &ldquo;five precepts&rdquo;: avoid taking life (animal or human), stealing, illicit sexual relations, lying, and intoxicants.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
&#x2013;
</p>

<p>
##. Jesus (Sacramental Pattern)
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Jesus is the fulfillment of the divine plan that began with the history of Israel.
</li>
<li>Jesus is believed by some to be the messiah, or Christ, described in the Jewish religious tradition.
</li>
<li>Jesus is also described as the Son of God, but there is disagreement as to whether this means that Jesus is an actual incarnation of the divine.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
&#x2013;
</p>

<p>
##. Jesus
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Classical Christian doctrine views Jesus as something more than a prophet or sage.
</li>
<li>In his life, death, and resurrection, God is incarnate, or present &ldquo;in the flesh.&rdquo;
</li>
<li>The actions of Jesus can be seen as signs of his divine nature.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Healing = God&rsquo;s power over sickness
</li>
<li>Teaching = God&rsquo;s willingness to guide humanity
</li>
<li>Raising People from the Dead = God&rsquo;s power over death
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>
&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
##. Sacred Objects
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Sacred objects are material items that have, or have had, importance in religious contexts.
</li>
<li>For example, books, statues, relics, foods.
</li>
<li>Some communities have perceived sacred reality in rocks, trees, or animals; others have focused on the sky, the earth, or the sun.
</li>
<li>Even the garments associated with holy persons take on the character of the sacred.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
&#x2013;
</p>

<p>
##. The Qur&rsquo;an as a Sacred Object
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The <b><b>Qur&rsquo;an</b></b> occupies a unique place in Muslim understanding.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It is recited in worship
</li>
<li>It is an object of ongoing and intensive study
</li>
<li>It is the first source for Islamic thinking about law, theology, and ethics
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Qur&rsquo;an is thus understood as a vehicle for the manifestation of sacred reality; therefore, it is a sacred object.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
&#x2013;
</p>

<p>
##. Tea as a Sacred Object
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In Zen Buddhism, practitioners attempt to concentrate in order to &ldquo;<b><b>see</b></b>&rdquo; the one thing that is essential.
</li>
<li>In the <b><b>tea ceremony</b></b>, attention is given to every detail of the preparation and drinking of tea.
</li>
<li>Thus, the tea is the focal point of concentration and can be understood as a sacred object in Zen Buddhism.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
&#x2013;
</p>

<p>
##. Holy Communion
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In the Christian tradition, some of the most sacred objects are the bread and wine used during communion.
</li>
<li>In some traditions, the bread and wine are representative of the body and blood of Christ.
</li>
<li>In other traditions, most notably Roman Catholicism, the bread and wine are in fact the body and blood of Christ.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
##. Sacred Time
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In those traditions most associated with a prophet, time appears as the creation and, in a sense, the &ldquo;field of revelation&rdquo; for sacred reality.
</li>
<li>In some religious traditions, the overall conception of <b><b>time is linear</b></b>: time has a beginning, and it will have an end.
</li>
<li>In other religious traditions, a <b><b>cyclical view of time prevails</b></b>: focuses on <b><b>repetition</b></b>, implying a story of slow yet ceaseless movement around a central point.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
&#x2013;
</p>

<p>
##. Samsara
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Popular in the great religions of India.
</li>
<li><b><b>Samsara</b></b> may be translated as &ldquo;<b><b>migration</b></b>&rdquo;
</li>
<li>Implies the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth that is characteristic of all beings.
</li>
<li>Samsara indicates a highly developed set of beliefs about personal and historical existence in which time is a medium of the sacred.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
&#x2013;
</p>

<p>
##. Moksha
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Both Buddhism and Hinduism speak of <b><b>Moksha</b></b>: the &ldquo;release&rdquo; or &ldquo;liberation&rdquo; from <b><b>Samsara</b></b>.
</li>
<li>Thus, for Buddhists and Hindus, time is a negative reality to be escaped.
</li>
<li>Contrast this notion of time with the notions of time associated with religions that worship an Earth goddess.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
&#x2013;
</p>

<p>
##. Sacred Space
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Includes traditional places of worship&amp;#x2013; <b><b>mosques, synagogues, churches, temples</b></b>.
</li>
<li>Also includes &ldquo;holy&rdquo; places&amp;#x2013; <b><b>Jerusalem, Mecca, Medina</b></b>, etc.
</li>
<li>In Shinto, the <b><b>Torii</b></b> marks the entrance to the territory of a <b><b>kami</b></b>.  The Torii are therefore sacred because they are the dwelling places of important deities.
</li>
<li>Burial mounds are also sacred spaces.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
##. Complexity of Traditions
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The identification of patterns in the appearance of the sacred suggests that there are characteristic &ldquo;types&rdquo; of religion, but these should not be pushed too far.
</li>
<li><b><b>Most religions have complex traditions that incorporate prophetic, sacramental, and mystical components</b></b>.
</li>
</ul>



<p>
&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
##  Sacred Language
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Many religious traditions possess a sacred language.
</li>
<li>Examples:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For Muslims, the <b><b>Arabic language</b></b> in which the Koran is written are Allah&rsquo;s very words.
</li>
<li>Many Orthodox Jews refuse to speak in modern <b><b>Hebrew</b></b> because the language of the Torah is sacred and cannot be used until the Messiah comes.
</li>
<li>Many Christians believe that it is a sin to misuse <b><b>the name of God</b></b> or Jesus.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>
&#x2013;
</p>

<p>
##  Names for the Sacred Reality
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The term sacred is used to refer to a dimension of reality beyond the world of immediate experience, but one with which human beings have contact.
</li>
<li>But there are many different names for this sacred reality.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>God
</li>
<li>Brahman
</li>
<li>Nirvana
</li>
<li>Heaven
</li>
<li>The Kami (sacred beings and powers in Shinto)
</li>
<li>Allah
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>
&#x2013;
</p>

<p>
##  The Sacred Defies Language
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In many traditions, there is an attempt to convey that the <b><b>sacred defies language</b></b> because it is unlike other realities.
</li>
<li>John of the Cross described his sense of God as <b><b>Todo y Nada</b></b> (<b>everything and nothing</b>).
</li>
<li>Hindu mystics describe the ultimate principle of the universe (<b><b>Brahman</b></b>) as &ldquo;<b>Neti, Neti</b>&rdquo; (neither this nor that).
</li>
<li>Saint Thomas argued that God&rsquo;s revelation comes to us in <b><b>metaphorical language</b></b> barely adequate to express the reality of God.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
&#x2013;
</p>

<p>
##  Forms of Language in the Bible
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The Bible conveys information in varied styles.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Narratives (e.g., the gospels)
</li>
<li>Poems and hymns (e.g., the Psalms)
</li>
<li>Proverbs
</li>
<li>Legal codes
</li>
<li>Sermons
</li>
<li>Letters
</li>
<li>Stories of beginnings and endings
</li>
<li>Parables and ethical reflections
</li>
<li>Chronicles and histories
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>
&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
##  Myth
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b><b>Myth</b></b> is the oldest and most widespread form of religious discourse.
</li>
<li>In the field of religious studies, myth indicates a <b><b>narrative concerning sacred reality</b></b> and its relationship to humanity.
</li>
<li>In its concern with sacred reality, myth is designed to <b><b>disclose the ultimate truth</b></b> about crucial human questions.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
&#x2013;
</p>

<p>
##  Myth as an Explanatory Model
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Myth is often used <b><b>to explain the world</b></b> and to answer important questions.
</li>
<li>For example, myths have been used to address the following topics:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The origin of the cosmos
</li>
<li>The final destiny of the world and its inhabitants
</li>
<li>How evil got into the world
</li>
<li>What the world was like at its beginnings
</li>
<li>How the world will eventually end and what will come after that ending
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>
&#x2013;
</p>

<p>
##  Creation Myths
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Every religious tradition has a myth (or story) that explains <b><b>the origins of the world.</b></b>
</li>
<li>Examples:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The creation story in Genesis
</li>
<li>Stories of great struggles between the Gods
</li>
<li>Stories of primordial chaos
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>
&#x2013;
</p>

<p>
## Understanding Creation Myths
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In religious studies, creation myths <b><b>should not be analyzed for their factual truth as a matter of historical fact</b></b>.
</li>
<li>Rather, such myths should be analyzed to determine the **basic premises behind the story and the notions of sacred reality reflected in the language and imagery of the creation myth.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
&#x2013;
</p>

<p>
## Biblical and Qur&rsquo;anic Creation Myth
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This creation myth conveys the following notions of sacred reality:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>God is not only independent of the world but &ldquo;stands outside&rdquo; it as its effortless creator
</li>
<li>The world is created as good&amp;#x2013;it is not evil, nor is it an illusion
</li>
<li>At the center of creation, both as apex and as steward, stand the primordial man and woman (Adam and Eve)
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>
&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
## Myths vs. Stories
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Myths are stories, but <b><b>they are stories of a certain kind</b></b>.
</li>
<li>Myths deal with &ldquo;cosmic&rdquo; questions: the origin of the world; the creation and meaning of human beings; stories of a lost paradise or golden age; stories about the end of the world and the manner of that end.
</li>
<li>Beyond those great mythic reconstructions are other stories&amp;#x2013; <b><b>narratives embedded in the historical religious experience of the people</b></b>.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
&#x2013;
</p>

<p>
## Official and Unofficial Stories
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Every religious tradition has its <b><b>official stories</b></b>.
</li>
<li>For example, in Hinduism, the great <b><b>Mahabharata</b></b> is an epic poem and an &ldquo;official story&rdquo; for that tradition.
</li>
<li>But every tradition also has a large number of &ldquo;unofficial stories&rdquo;.
</li>
<li>Such unofficial stories consist primarily of narrative accounts of an individual&rsquo;s personal encounter with the sacred.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
&#x2013;
</p>

<p>
## The Function of Religious Stories
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Stories are a kind of discourse that <b><b>passes on information, insights, lessons, and instructions</b></b>.
</li>
<li>In this sense, religious stories contain material that people think is worth remembering.
</li>
<li>Such stories give shape to religious tradition.
</li>
<li>Religious stories also recall paradigmatic moments and/or persons.
</li>
<li>Religious stories thus are not simply &ldquo;handed down&rdquo;; they provide models to emulate.
</li>
</ul>


<p>

</p>

<p>
## The Function of Religious Stories
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Religious stories are vehicles for disclosure or revelation.
</li>
<li>Such stories may recount events that could be called &ldquo;ordinary,&rdquo; but for the believing community, they mediate sacred reality
</li>
</ul>


<p>
&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
## Sacred Texts
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In many traditions, religious myths and stories are set down in a written text and receive an official form.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Bible
</li>
<li>Qur&rsquo;an
</li>
<li>Torah
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Many of these books are themselves treated as sacred objects.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Enshrining the scrolls of the Torah in an ark
</li>
<li>Kissing the scriptures
</li>
<li>Memorization of the Qur&rsquo;an
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>
&#x2013;
</p>

<p>
## Story as Parable
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The parable is another special type of religious language that is distinct from both myth and story.
</li>
<li>Unlike the myth, which deals with great, cosmic issues such as origins, the parable deals with immediate, existential realities
</li>
<li>A parable is a story, usually fictional, in which the narrative thrust is to make a point, but the elements of the story do not always stand for something else. The point to be grasped arises from the story in its own right.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
&#x2013;
</p>

<p>
## Parables
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The parable is meant to arrest the hearer or reader in such a way that he or she must think of things in a new and unaccustomed manner.
</li>
<li>The parable has a certain element of the puzzling or the outrageous that carries with it a kind of &ldquo;shock value,"which calls into question comfortable assumptions.
</li>
<li>The gospels depict Jesus as a teller of parables&amp;#x2013;a technique that is also common in rabbinic literature.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
## Preservation of Sacred Language
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For many religious people, words have a peculiar power because they point to and/or reveal the sacred dimension of reality.
</li>
<li>For this reason, religious stories, myths, etc. are preserved within religious communities.
</li>
<li>Such stories constitute the peculiar memory and the accumulated power of a given religious tradition. In fact, one way different kinds of religions may be distinguished is according to the manner in which they effect this preservation.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
&#x2013;
</p>

<p>
## Oral Cultures
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In oral cultures, religious stories and myths are transmitted orally from one generation to the next.
</li>
<li>Examples of oral cultures abound among the indigenous or aboriginal peoples of various parts of the world:
</li>
<li>Indians of North, Central, and South America
</li>
<li>Tribal cultures of Africa
</li>
<li>Aborigines of Asia, Australia, and New Zealand
</li>
</ul>


<p>
&#x2013;
</p>

<p>
## Transmission in Oral Cultures
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The transmission of religious stories may be the special task of certain families or designated &ldquo;wise persons.&rdquo;
</li>
<li>Certain stories may be taught to the young of the tribe at appropriate times (e.g., at the onset of sexual maturity).
</li>
<li>These stories or myths are often told only at certain occasions or at certain times; they are sacred and, more to the point, sacred for specific reasons and specific times.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
## Scriptural Cultures
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The word &ldquo;scripture&rdquo; comes from Latin and means simply &ldquo;that which is written.&rdquo;
</li>
<li>Many of the great religions of the world preserve their inherited past and their religious language in writing.
</li>
<li>The three great religions of the West are referred to as &ldquo;religions of the book&rdquo; because of their emphasis on the written word.
</li>
<li>However, written records of religious language are also important for the great religions of the East.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
&#x2013;
</p>

<p>
## Canonical Texts
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Canon (from the Greek word meaning a &ldquo;list&rdquo;) refers to a particular set of books or a single book that is authoritative for a religious community.
</li>
<li>In Christianity, the canon of scripture (the Bible) is the list (canon) of texts read in public worship.
</li>
<li>In Theravada Buddhism, numerous works systematize and comment on discourses of the Buddha.  But only the collection of texts known as tripitaka are authoritative or canonical.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
&#x2013;
</p>

<p>
## Why Do Religious Stories Persist?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Sacred stories are a means of connecting with the sacred dimension of existence.
</li>
<li>Religious stories &ldquo;order the cosmos.&rdquo; The basic purpose of myth is to provide coherence to the world in which the believer lives.
</li>
<li>With respect to the communal or social aspect of religion, stories give shape to memory; they sustain and nourish a tradition.
</li>
<li>Also in connection with the communal aspect of religion, stories serve an ethical function.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
## Language of Theology
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A theologian is a believer who reflects on the fact of personal and communal faith in such a way as to clarify it and/or to argue that such faith is worthy of consideration by those outside his or her community.
</li>
<li>Theology is a second level discourse.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The theologian attempts to set forth, systematically and conceptually, the meaning of the stories of a particular tradition.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>
&#x2013;
</p>

<p>
## Visual Language of Religion
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The visual language of religion includes the use of painting, sculpture, architecture, and the other arts as a means of conveying a sense of the sacred.
</li>
<li>Long before writing became the primary vehicle for communication, people used visual images to communicate and preserve their religious traditions.
</li>
<li>The oldest examples of religious language available are paintings (e.g., the cave paintings of neolithic peoples).
</li>
