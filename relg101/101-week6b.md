1. In the first chapter of the novel, Siddhartha's father tells his son, "When you'll have found blissfulness in the forest, then come back and teach me to be blissful. If you'll find disappointment, then return and let us once again make offerings to the gods together." 

The novel ends shortly after Siddhartha achieves enlightenment at the river. Nothing is said about whether he plans to return home. If you had written the novel, would you have extended its length with a chapter in which he goes home to see his father? Explain your answer.

"Most people, Kamala, are like a falling leaf, which is blown and is turning around through the air, and wavers, and tumbles to the ground.
