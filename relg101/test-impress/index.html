<h2>Basic outline of the evidence for the hypothesis</h2>

<p><em>There is strong evidence that almost *</em>every** book in the Hebrew Bible is a &quot;composite&quot; publication and not the product of just <strong>one</strong> author*</p>

<ul>
<li>Some texts in Genesis refer to God as <em>Yahweh</em>, whereas others call him <em>Elohim</em>. Those texts that call him <em>Yahweh</em>  may be assigned to J, who thought the name <em>Yahweh</em> was revealed to humanity well before the patriarchal age began. Those texts that refer to God as Elohim may be assigned to E or P, both of whom thought the name Yahweh was not revealed until the Exodus. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The language and style of the documents vary. J is said to have been a masterful </li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The confused history of the Israelite priesthood found in the Pentateuch is best explained by the Documentary Hypothesis. In some texts (e.g. Deuteronomy), all Levites are priests. In other texts, (the P portions of Exodus and Leviticus), only the Aaronites are priests and the rest of the Levites are mere hierodules-workers in the temple without priestly privileges. The Pentateuch, therefore, cannot be a unified work from a single hand. Rather, documents D and P come from different perspectives and different ages.</li>
