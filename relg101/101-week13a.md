References to Abraham in the Quran[edit] <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_in_Islam#References_to_Abraham_in_the_Quran>
There are numerous references to Abraham in the Quran, including, twice, to the Scrolls of Abraham;in the latter passage, it is mentioned that Abraham "fulfilled his engagements?-",a reference to all the trials that Abraham had succeeded in. In a whole series of chapters, the Quran relates how Abraham preached to his community as a youth and how he specifically told his father, named Azar,to leave idol-worship and come to the worship of God.Some passages of the Quran, meanwhile, deal with the story of how God sent angels to Abraham with the announcement of the punishment to be imposed upon Lot's people in Sodom and Gomorrah.Other verses mention the near-sacrifice of Abraham's son,whose name is not given but is presumed to be Ishmael as the following verses mention the birth of Isaac.The Quran also repeatedly establishes Abraham's role as patriarch and mentions numerous important descendants who came through his lineage, including Isaac,Jacoband Ishmael.In the later chapters of the Quran, Abraham's role becomes yet more prominent. The Quran mentions that Abraham and Ishmael were the reformers who set up the Kabba in Mecca as a center of pilgrimage for monotheismThe Quran consistently refers to Islam as "the Religion of Abraham" (millat Ibrahim)and Abraham is given a title as Hanif (The Pure, "true in Faith" or "upright man").The Quran also mentions Abraham as one whom God took as a friend (Khalil),hence Abraham's title in Islam, Khalil-Allah (Friend of God). The term is considered by some to be a derivation of the patriarch's Hebrew title, Kal El (קל-אל), which means "voice of God".Other instances in the Quran which are described in a concise manner are the rescue of Abraham from the fire into which he was thrown by his people';his pleading for his father;his quarrel with an unrighteous and powerful kingand the miracle of the dead birds.
