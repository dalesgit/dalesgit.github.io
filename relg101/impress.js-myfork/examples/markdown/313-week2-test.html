## Basic outline of the evidence for the hypothesis

*There is strong evidence that almost **every** book in the Hebrew Bible is a "composite" publication and not the product of just **one** author*

-----

- Some texts in Genesis refer to God as *Yahweh*, whereas others call him *Elohim*. Those texts that call him *Yahweh*  may be assigned to J, who thought the name *Yahweh* was revealed to humanity well before the patriarchal age began. Those texts that refer to God as Elohim may be assigned to E or P, both of whom thought the name Yahweh was not revealed until the Exodus. 

-----
- Genesis contains some duplicate stories and repetitions. This is because each of the two source documents contained its own version of a single tradition. Thus 12:10--20 (J) and 20:1--18 (E) 26:6-11 (?) are variants of a single tradition. Sometimes the two variant versions were redacted into a single narrative, yet the documents behind the single redaction are still apparent. J and P each had a version of the Flood story, for example, but these have been combined in the present text. 
- Contradictions within Genesis indicate the existence of the separate documents. The implication is that one document had one tradition, but a second had another.

-----
- The language and style of the documents vary. J is said to have been a masterful storyteller, but P is prosaic and wordy. Each document also has its own preferred vocabulary. For the English “begot.” J prefers the G stem yld, but P uses the H stem hôîid. 
- Each document, when extracted from the present text of Genesis, shows itself to have been a continuous, meaningful piece of literature. In particular, it is possible to see a specific literary and theological purpose behind each. This validates the method. 
- Even on a superficial reading, some texts obviously involve more than one source. The best example is *Genesis 1--2*, which can hardly come from a single source. Instead, 1:1 and Genesis 2:4ff. must be regarded as separate works. The presence of obvious examples of separate sources in a text validates the principles of the *Documentary Hypothesis,* which may then be applied to texts where the source division is not obvious. 

-----
- The confused history of the Israelite priesthood found in the Pentateuch is best explained by the Documentary Hypothesis. In some texts (e.g. Deuteronomy), all Levites are priests. In other texts, (the P portions of Exodus and Leviticus), only the Aaronites are priests and the rest of the Levites are mere hierodules-workers in the temple without priestly privileges. The Pentateuch, therefore, cannot be a unified work from a single hand. Rather, documents D and P come from different perspectives and different ages.

# Markdown 
## to author Impress.js presentations

* This presentation was written entirely in Markdown
* Added by popular request
  * Easy way to make quick, simple yet aesthetic, presentations
  * Authoring without all the clutter of HTML

-----
# Markdown.js

* Provided by [Markdown.js](https://github.com/evilstreak/markdown-js) in [extras/](https://github.com/henrikingo/impress.js/tree/myfork/extras)
* Jot down your bullet points in *Markdown* & have it automatically converted to HTML
* Note: The Markdown is converted into a presentation client side, in the browser. This is unlike
  existing tools like [Hovercraft](https://github.com/regebro/hovercraft) and 
  [markdown-impress](http://binbinliao.com/markdown-impress/) where you generate a new
  html file on the command line.
* This combines the ease of typing Markdown with the full power of impress.js HTML5+CSS3+JavaScript!

-----
# Styles

* You can use *italics* & **bold**
* ...and `code`

# Code

When also using [Highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) integration, code blocks in Markdown
are converted to HTML first, then colored by Highlight.js:

        // `init` API function that initializes (and runs) the presentation.
        var init = function () {
            if (initialized) { return; }
            execPreInitPlugins();
            
            // First we set up the viewport for mobile devices.
            // For some reason iPad goes nuts when it is not done properly.
            var meta = $("meta[name='viewport']") || document.createElement("meta");
            meta.content = "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no";
            if (meta.parentNode !== document.head) {
                meta.name = 'viewport';
                document.head.appendChild(meta);
            }

# Slide separator

* 5 dashes are used to separate slides:

`-----`

* Attributes from `div.step` element are simply repeated.
  * Better use relative positioning, lest your slides will all be on top of each other.
* If you need to set some attributes, just use HTML and create a div element, then write 
  Markdown inside each div.
</div>

<div id="title-slide" class="step slide title markdown" data-x="2000" data-y="5000">
# Title slide
## This slide has different CSS class than the previous ones
</div>


<div id="tilted-slide" class="step slide markdown" data-rotate="-85" data-x="2000" data-y="2000" data-z="1000" data-scale="4">
# Simplicity of Markdown & Full power of Impress.js
  
* This slide sets its own `rotate`, `x`, `y`, and even `z` coordinates
* Note that the Mother Teresa slide earlier was pimped with some custom CSS, all the while
  the content was written in simple Markdown.

<script type="text/javascript">

<h1>CSS &amp; JavaScript magic</h1>

<p>Just to emphasize my point, this last slide allows you to use a JavaScript powered menu to
toggle the CSS style:</p>

<p><a href="#" onclick="enableBwCss();" class="css-menu-bw">Black &amp; white</a>, 
<a href="#" onclick="enableDevopsCss();" class="css-menu-devopsy">Devopsy</a>, 
<a href="#" onclick="enableEffectsCss();" class="css-menu-effects">Effects overload</a></p>

    To make all described above really work, you need to include impress.js in the page.
    You also need to call a `impress().init()` function to initialize impress.js presentation.
    And you should do it in the end of your document.
