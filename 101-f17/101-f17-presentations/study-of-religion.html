Religious studies is the attempt to study these things, taking <b>homo religiosus</b> seriously

<li class="fragment appear"><b>Offer Generalizations</b> about religious patterns and about religion itself.

<blockquote nil>
<p>
A religious phenomenon will only be recognized as such if it is grasped at its own level, that is to say, if it is studied as something religious. To try to grasp the essence of such a phenomenon by means of physiology, sociology, economics, linguistics, art or any other study is false; it

<h3 id="orgd08ec18">"What is required is perspective" (p. 8)</h3>
<p>
A North American touring the highlands of New Guinea for a visit to one of the tribes living in the outback might well witness men decorated in bird-of-paradise feathers, nude (save for a penis sheath), covered in ashes, and dancing before a fire at the side of which are pigs bound in vines and banana leaves. His or her first reaction might well be to take some photographs in order to show “the folks back home” some  of the exotic aspects of life among primitive peoples. But this picture can be reversed.

<p>
Suppose the tribesmen of the outback visit a downtown church on Sunday morning. They observe rows of oddly dressed people (what, after all, is the purpose of a necktie?), notice that some sit while others sing, listen to one person speak at length, and see still others pass plates onto which paper and metal disks are placed. What are these tribesmen to think? Where, after all, are the pigs? The fire? The sacred feathers? In both cases, the observer lacks a sense of perspective and context.

<p>
The lesson is a simple one. It is impossible to get at the intention that lies behind religious behavior unless we have a willingness to <b>enter sympathetically into the cultural worldview of another person</b>, at least for a moment.
