<ul>
<li>called a <strong>hierophany</strong> -- &quot;to reveal&quot; + &quot;sacred&quot;</li>
<li>sacred made manifest in the world</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: <strong>The appearance of the sacred is technically called a hierophany, from the two Greek words that mean “to reveal the sacred.”</strong> <strong>The “appearance of the sacred” can be understood as the ways in which the sacred is made manifest in the world of human experience.</strong> <strong>Examples:</strong> - The Angel who appeared to Muhammad (<em>Muhammad's revelation was an event described in Islam as taking place in 610 AD, during which the Islamic prophet, Muhammad was visited by the archangel Jibrīl, who revealed to him the beginnings of what would later become the Quran. The event took place in a cave called Hira, located on the mountain Jabal an-Nour, near Mecca</em>.) - The Enlightenment of the Buddha (<em>The Bodhi Tree (Sanskrit: बोधि), also known as Bo (from Sinhalese: Bo), &quot;peepal tree&quot;, or &quot;arasa maram&quot; (Tamil:)(Devanagari: पीपल क पेड़), was a large and ancient sacred fig tree (Ficus religiosa[1][2]) located in Bodh Gaya, Bihar, India, under which Siddhartha Gautama, the spiritual teacher who became known as the Buddha, is said to have attained enlightenment or Bodhi.[3] In religious iconography, the Bodhi Tree is recognizable by its heart-shaped leaves, which are usually prominently displayed</em>. )</p>

<h3 id="examples-of-sacred-persons">Examples of Sacred persons</h3>
<p><strong>sacred persons who were also “founders” of religious traditions.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Moses,</li>
<li>Jesus,</li>
<li>Muhammad,</li>
<li>the Buddha,</li>
<li>Confucius, and</li>
<li>Lao-tzu</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="sacred-persons"><strong>Sacred Persons</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The association of the sacred with certain persons is a characteristic of numerous religious traditions.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Sacred persons are most obviously found in those religious traditions whose history points to a “founder” or great figure at the beginning of the tradition.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Note: - <strong>Moses, Jesus, Muhammad, the Buddha, Confucius, and Lao-tzu are famous examples of sacred persons who were also “founders” of religious traditions.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Moses (Prophetic Pattern)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The great prophet of Judaism.</strong></li>
<li><strong>In Hebrew, a prophet is one who speaks with the authority of another (i.e. God).</strong></li>
<li><strong>Moses’ connection with sacred reality is, in one sense, the point of many of the stories told in the biblical books of Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy.</strong></li>
<li><strong>In the biblical stories, Moses’ primary role is as a spokesman, that is, a prophet, for the “Holy One of Israel.”</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Moses</strong></p>
<p><strong>Moses is sacred as a spokesman for God.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>He brings to the people of Israel the Torah or instruction he receives from God.</li>
<li>He receives from God not only the written Torah of the various biblical commandments but also the oral Torah by which to interpret these commandments.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In the end, Moses is regarded as the best of all humanity.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Buddha (Mystical Pattern)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Buddha is sacred as the teacher of the truth about human existence.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Buddha is also sacred as the sage who, having attained enlightenment, is able to guide others to the experience of Nirvana.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Like Moses, the Buddha has a message to proclaim. But the message of the Buddha is not the “instruction” of God.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Buddha</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The “message” of the Buddha is the insight of a master of meditation into the essential nature of all things.</strong></li>
<li><strong>As a “sage,” he speaks with the authority gained from his personal acquisition of wisdom.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Thus, the Buddha grasps something that is, for most, “hidden” (the root meaning of “mystic”) and brings it forth.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Buddha</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Buddha gives his life to the teaching of his doctrine, known as “dharma.”</strong></li>
<li><strong>This dharma teaches that the way to enlightenment is a “middle way,” a way given neither to sumptuous living nor to extravagant self-discipline, but to the contemplation of the Four Noble Truths.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Ultimately, the Buddha’s connection with the sacred has to do with this dharma—or the wisdom that he is able to impart to seekers of the truth.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Buddha</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Buddha teaches anyone willing to listen, and he has useful advice to offer, no matter how far short one is of the ultimate goal.</strong></li>
<li><strong>For those ready to renounce all in pursuit of Nirvana, the Buddha holds out participation in the <em>sangha or order of</em> monks and nuns.</strong></li>
<li><strong>For those less far along, he offers basic spiritual practice, including the “five precepts”: avoid taking life (animal or human), stealing, illicit sexual relations, lying, and intoxicants.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Jesus (Sacramental Pattern)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Jesus is the fulfillment of the divine plan that began with the history of Israel.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Jesus is believed by some to be the messiah, or Christ, described in the Jewish religious tradition.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Jesus is also described as the Son of God, but there is disagreement as to whether this means that Jesus is an actual incarnation of the divine.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Jesus</strong></p>
<p><strong>Classical Christian doctrine views Jesus as something more than a prophet or sage.</strong></p>
<p><strong>In his life, death, and resurrection, God is incarnate, or present “in the flesh.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>The actions of Jesus can be seen as signs of his divine nature.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Healing = God’s power over sickness</li>
<li>Teaching = God’s willingness to guide humanity</li>
<li>Raising People from the Dead = God’s power over death</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="sacred-objects"><strong>Sacred Objects</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sacred objects are material items that have, or have had, importance in religious contexts.</strong></li>
<li><strong>For example, books, statues, relics, foods.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Some communities have perceived sacred reality in rocks, trees, or animals; others have focused on the sky, the earth, or the sun.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Even the garments associated with holy persons take on the character of the sacred.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Note: <strong>The Qur’an as a Sacred Object</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Qur’an occupies a unique place in Muslim understanding.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is recited in worship</li>
<li>It is an object of ongoing and intensive study</li>
<li>It is the first source for Islamic thinking about law, theology, and ethics</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Qur’an is thus understood as a vehicle for the manifestation of sacred reality; therefore, it is a sacred object.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tea as a Sacred Object</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In Zen Buddhism, practitioners attempt to concentrate in order to “see” the one thing that is essential.</strong></li>
<li><strong>In the tea ceremony, attention is given to every detail of the preparation and drinking of tea.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Thus, the tea is the focal point of concentration and can be understood as a sacred object in Zen Buddhism.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Holy Communion</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In the Christian tradition, some of the most sacred objects are the bread and wine used during communion.</strong></li>
<li><strong>In some traditions, the bread and wine are representative of the body and blood of Christ.</strong></li>
<li><strong>In other traditions, most notably Roman Catholicism, the bread and wine are in fact the body and blood of Christ.</strong></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="sacred-time"><strong>Sacred Time</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>traditions associated with the <strong>prophetic</strong> -- sacred time may be creation itself, or the time of the revelation</li>
<li>linear time vs.</li>
<li>circular time</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: - <strong>In those traditions most associated with a prophet, time appears as the creation and, in a sense, the “field of revelation” for sacred reality.</strong> - <strong>In some religious traditions, the overall conception of time is linear: time has a beginning, and it will have an end.</strong> - <strong>In other religious traditions, a cyclical view of time prevails: focuses on repetition, implying a story of slow yet ceaseless movement around a central point.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Samsara</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Popular in the great religions of India.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Samsara may be translated as “migration”</strong></li>
<li><strong>Implies the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth that is characteristic of all beings.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Samsara indicates a highly developed set of beliefs about personal and historical existence in which time is a medium of the sacred.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Moksha</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Both Buddhism and Hinduism speak of Moksha: the “release” or “liberation” from Samsara.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Thus, for Buddhists and Hindus, time is a negative reality to be escaped.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Contrast this notion of time with the notions of time associated with religions that worship an Earth goddess.</strong></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="sacred-space"><strong>Sacred Space</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>places of worship</li>
<li>holy cities or other places</li>
<li>shrines</li>
<li>cemeteries, burial mounds, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: - <strong>Includes traditional places of worship—mosques, synagogues, churches, temples.</strong> - <strong>Also includes “holy” places—Jerusalem, Mecca, Medina, etc.</strong> - <strong>In Shinto, the Torii marks the entrance to the territory of a kami. The Torii are therefore sacred because they are the dwelling places of important deities.</strong> - <strong>Burial mounds are also sacred spaces.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Complexity of Traditions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The identification of patterns in the appearance of the sacred suggests that there are characteristic “types” of religion, but these should not be pushed too far.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Most religions have complex traditions that incorporate prophetic, sacramental, and mystical components.</strong></li>
</ul>
