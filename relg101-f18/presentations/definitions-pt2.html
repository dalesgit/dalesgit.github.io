<h3 id="functionalist-definition-of-religion">Functionalist Definition of Religion</h3>
<ul>
<li>Focuses on the role religion plays in the lives of persons and groups.</li>
<li>Might focus on the ways religion enables people to sustain hope in the face of difficult circumstances.</li>
<li>“Functionalist” understands <strong>religion</strong> to have to do with the role it plays ordering, making sense, of human existence</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="substantive-definition-of-religion">Substantive Definition of Religion</h3>
<ul>
<li>Attempts to limit the phenomena that may be characterized as religious.</li>
<li>Seeks to identify what it is that makes certain responses to death and suffering religious and others not.</li>
<li>“Substantive” recognizes that <strong>religion</strong> to be contrasted with the many other … isms or ways of thought etc. that function to make life bearable, ordered, etc. (cf. Martineau's definition above)</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="definition-must-be-both">Definition must be both</h3>
<ul>
<li>Considerations of function are necessary but not sufficient to the task of defining religion.</li>
<li>But an adequate definition of religion must include a substantive component.</li>
<li>Thus, <strong>any adequate definition of religion must account for both the function and substance of religion.</strong></li>
</ul>

<hr />
<h3 id="religion-signifies-those-ways-of-viewing-the-world-that-refer-to">Religion signifies those ways of viewing the world that refer to:</h3>
<ol>
<li>a notion of sacred reality</li>
<li>made manifest in human experience</li>
<li>in such a way as to produce long-lasting ways of thinking, feeling, and acting</li>
<li>with respect to problems of ordering and understanding existence</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2 id="a-notion-of-sacred-reality">A Notion of Sacred Reality</h2>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>notion of sacred reality establishes a boundary between religion and non-religion.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Sacred</strong> indicates a reality that is somehow distinct, set apart, other than <strong>ordinary</strong>.</li>
<li>Sacred reality includes the God of the <strong>Bible</strong>, the <strong>Qur'anic Allah</strong>, the <strong>Brahman</strong> of Hinduism, Buddhism's <strong>Nirvana</strong>, the <strong>kami</strong> of Shinto.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="manifest-in-human-experience">Manifest in Human Experience</h3>
<ul>
<li>Although the sacred is set apart from the ordinary, it nevertheless may be experienced, thought about, and acted upon.</li>
<li>Thus, all religion has to do with the element of the <strong>sacred manifesting itself in various ways</strong>: in rituals, persons, and natural phenomena.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: 1. Muslims = the sacred reality (****Allah****) is made manifest through prophecy 2. Buddhists = the goal of <strong>Nirvana</strong> comes to life in the life and teaching of the Buddha 3. Navaho = the story of the Navaho people makes wisdom available for those who seek harmony between all things.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="long-lasting-ways-of-thinking-and-feeling">Long-Lasting Ways of Thinking and Feeling</h3>
<ul>
<li>Religious ways develop over time. And they come to constitute traditions that may be identified with the history of particular communities.</li>
<li>For example, the prophecy of Muhammad is the beginning of the tradition of Islam.</li>
<li>Islam's message and the story of its revelation in seventh-century Arabia have produced characteristic modes of thought, feeling, and action among a large percentage of the world's population.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="ordering-and-understanding-existence">Ordering and Understanding Existence</h3>
<ul>
<li>Stresses the way in which notions of sacred reality are related to problems of suffering and death.</li>
<li>Also stresses the way in which notions of sacred reality are related to other problems; such as the ordering of political or economic life.</li>
</ul>
