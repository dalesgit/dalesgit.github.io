<h2 id="ritual-defined">Ritual Defined</h2>
<ul>
<li>A ritual is a ceremonial act or a repeated stylized gesture used for specific occasions.
<li class="fragment">In society, there are many civic rituals. </li>
<li class="fragment">In American courts, raising the right hand, swearing on the Bible, and reciting an oath signifies the obligation to tell the truth. </li>
<li class="fragment">In everyday life we participate in numerous personal rituals. </li>
<li class="fragment">Shaking hands as a sign of mutual trust </li>
<li class="fragment">Standing in honor of a particular person </li></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="ritual----questions">Ritual -- Questions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Give an example of a ritual that orders your interaction with others.
<li class="fragment">What is a ritual that has important meaning for you and your friends or family?  Explain. </li>
<li class="fragment">How does ritual help us to understand the ways that religion is more than a set of beliefs? </li>
<li class="fragment">What are the best arguments for and against the following claim: “Religion begins with ritual and it remains ritual before it is anything else.” </li>
<li class="fragment">How can ritual go wrong?  What happens when it goes right? </li></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="ritual-in-religious-contexts">Ritual in Religious Contexts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ritual plays an important role in every religious tradition.</li>
<li>Some religions are famous for their ritual character.
<li class="fragment">    Roman Catholicism</li>
<li class="fragment">    Russian Orthodoxy</li>
<li class="fragment">Other religions are known for their resistance to ritual, but even these religions have certain stylized forms of behavior that are rituals.</li>
<li class="fragment">Society of Friends (Quakers)</li></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="mythos-and-ritual">Mythos and Ritual</h2>
<ul>
<li>One of the most common forms of ritual involves acting out or dramatizing religious stories.
<li class="fragment">The conjunction of myth and ritual serves as a way for people to participate in the creative power of the sacred. </li>
<li class="fragment">In many tribal societies people not only remember the tribal myths but also live them and act them out. </li></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="ritual-reenactment">Ritual Reenactment</h2>
<ul>
<li>In tribal societies, creation stories may be ritualized through dance and gesture at particular times of the year so that people reenact - the first deeds of gods and goddesses.
<li class="fragment">The Greek tragedy is derived from the ritualized worship of the Dionysus. </li>
<li class="fragment">The modern drama derives from the acting out of the Easter story in French monasteries during the Middle Ages. </li></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="the-passover">The Passover</h2>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Passover</strong> meal is also called the seder, a Hebrew word that means “order” or “arrangement.”
<li class="fragment">Commemorates the meal eaten by the Jews as the were delivered from slavery </li>
<li class="fragment">Retelling the story of the **Exodus** is central to the meal </li>
<li class="fragment">The **Passover** meal is not merely a historical remembrance. </li></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>The key thing to remember is that the meal is far more than just a meal</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For Jews participating in the Passover meal, there is a combination of memory, worship, and hope.
<li class="fragment">To celebrate the Passover is to become ritually one with those who first observed it before leaving Egypt. </li>
<li class="fragment">Thus, Jews celebrate an ancient story in their tradition by reenacting the story in a highly ritualized fashion </li></li>
</ul>
<p>Note: - At Passover, Jews all over the world gather in their homes to share a formal meal involving the eating of symbolic foods, various readings and prayers, and a number of blessings. - The meal is orchestrated by the head of the household, who conducts it according to well established traditions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Passover commemorates the meal eaten by the Jews the evening before they left Egypt and the enslavement of their people in order to journey toward, and eventually reach, the Promised Land.</li>
<li>Central to the Passover meal are the great events described in the Bible in the book of Exodus.</li>
<li>One of the high points of the meal comes when the youngest person present at the table asks why the meal is eaten. The response comes in the form of a reading from the haggadah.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="holy-communion">Holy Communion</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Holy Communion</strong> in Christianity functions in ways that are analogous to the <strong>Passover</strong> in Judaism.
<li class="fragment">The various Christian communities give diverse interpretations of the significance of communion.</li>
<li class="fragment">However, all Christian groups agree that when they celebrate the communion meal, they are reenacting events connected with Jesus of Nazareth.</li></li>
</ul>
<p>Note: - The gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, as well as the letter of Paul known as First Corinthians, describe a ceremony involving the use of bread and wine, which are given significance through words attributed to Jesus. - Holy Communion is a ritual reenactment of this story. - Like the Passover meal, the celebration of Holy Communion carries a meaning that the community of believers, long after the event itself, wishes to restate.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="other-examples-of-religious-rituals">Other examples of Religious Rituals</h2>
<ul>
<li>In <strong>Shi’a Islam</strong>, the “passion plays” of the month of <strong>Muharram</strong> reenact the martyrdom of <strong>Husayn</strong> at Karbala in 692 C.E.
<li class="fragment">In Shinto, the rituals performed at shrines throughout Japan reenact the conflict between the sun goddess and the god of storms </li>
<li class="fragment">thus the participants themselves are a part of the struggle to bring order to the world</li></li>
</ul>
<p>Note: - In <strong>Shi’a Islam</strong>, the “passion plays” of the month of <strong>Muharram</strong> reenact the martyrdom of <strong>Husayn</strong> at Karbala in 692 C.E. and draw members of the Shi’a community into an eternal drama in which good suffers in its struggle with evil. - In Shinto, the rituals performed at shrines throughout Japan reenact the conflict between <strong>Amaterasu</strong> (the sun goddess) and <strong>Susanoo</strong> (the god of storms) and enable participants to feel themselves a part of the struggle to bring order to the world.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="rites-of-passage">Rites of Passage</h2>
<ul>
<li>Rites of passage describe those ceremonies associated with the transitional moments in a person’s life.
<li class="fragment">All religions provide rituals of some sort or another </li>
<li class="fragment">Rituals may transformed to be for **nominal** believers to observe customs of tradition (e.g. weddings) </li></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<strong>All rites of passage have three phases:</strong> - separation,
<li class="fragment">liminal, and </li>
<li class="fragment">reintegration.</li>
<p>Note: - All religions provide rituals and/or theological rationales to commemorate such moments. - Even nominal believers who feel no great need to observe most of the customs of a tradition may still turn to religion for rites of passage.</p>

<ul>
<li>Birth rituals
<li class="fragment">Initiation rites</li>
<li class="fragment">in Postmodern Society?</li>
<li class="fragment">Mourning & Death</li>
<li class="fragment">temporal rites & celebrations</li></li>

<li class="fragment">Rites of Initiation </li>
<li class="fragment">Rituals of Mourning & Death </li>
<li class="fragment">Rites of passage of time, e.g. cycle of the year, cycle of seasons </li>
<h2 id="birth-rituals">Birth Rituals</h2>
<ul>
<li>Although some traditional cultures actually ritualize the moment of birth, “birth rituals” usually refer to rites connected to the newborn and its parents.</li>
<li>For Jews and Muslims, circumcision initiates male children into the religious community.</li>
<li>In Christian communities, baptism makes the child a member of the Christian church.</li>
<li>Hindus use a ritualized feeding to initiate a male member into the duties of his caste.</li>
<li>Similar meanings are given to birth rituals in the various religious traditions, even though the forms are quite diverse.</li>
<li>People celebrate the safe passage of the infant from the womb into the world; they welcome him or her into the family; they give the child a name; they pay homage to the creative power of the sacred.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rituals-of-initiation">Rituals of Initiation</h2>
<ul>
<li>Rituals of initiation celebrate and symbolize the passage of a person from childhood into adulthood.</li>
<li>While the specifics of this rite varied in different cultures, the outlines of the ceremony remained rather constant:
<ul>
<li>ritual segregation from the larger group and some form of testing</li>
<li>the actual ceremonies of initiation</li>
<li>reentry into the group as a recognized adult</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="initiation-rites-in-postmodern-society">Initiation Rites in Postmodern Society</h2>
<ul>
<li>In contemporary society, many young people go through a traditional rite of passage, but the “adults” are not really adults for some time after their “passage.”</li>
<li>Today, the most common ritual of initiation is marriage.</li>
<li>Many elements of the marriage rite hearken back to ancient rituals.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rituals-of-mourning-and-death">Rituals of Mourning and Death</h2>
<ul>
<li>Different religious traditions ritualize the mourning process in various ways.
<ul>
<li>Taoist rites include an elaborate ritual involving an enactment of the soul’s journey into the underworld and its rescue and delivery into heaven by ancestral spirits.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Many burial rites symbolize the relationship of human beings to the natural world.
<ul>
<li>Pious Hindus in India cremate their dead and consign the ashes to the river Ganges as a sign of the never-ending cycle of life and death.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rituals-of-mourning-and-death-1">Rituals of Mourning and Death</h2>
<ul>
<li>Funeral rites are intended to accomplish different ends in different cultures.</li>
<li>To aid the spirits of the dead to journey through the afterworld either by providing symbolic gifts for them (ancient Egyptians and native peoples of North America).</li>
<li>To provide living “guides” for the dead (Taoism).</li>
<li>To help the souls of the dead to purge sin (Roman Catholicism and Orthodoxy).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="temporal-rites-and-celebrations">Temporal Rites and Celebrations</h2>
<ul>
<li>The observance of cycles of time has been a central characteristic of most, if not all, historic religious traditions.</li>
<li>For people who hunted, gathered, or planted, the cycle of the seasons was crucial to life. As a result, great celebrations and rituals were associated with the change of the seasons.</li>
<li>Even in modern industrial societies, many of the great festivals continue to take place in conjunction with the change of the seasons.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="religious-meanings-of-ritual">Religious Meanings of Ritual</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ritual is so closely identified with formal worship that one can generally say that the ends of ritual are the ends of worship.</li>
<li>Traditionally speaking, worship promotes one of these four ends or purposes, or a combination of them:
<ul>
<li>Adoration</li>
<li>Thanksgiving</li>
<li>Petition</li>
<li>Penance/purification</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="adoration">Adoration</h2>
<ul>
<li>Basically, adoration means acknowledgment of the sovereignty of the Sacred over the person.</li>
<li>Adoration means the acknowledgment that one is not self-sufficient, but dependent.</li>
<li>In religions with a personal, transcendent God, there are basic ritual gestures assumed in moments of prayer that dramatically illustrate the concept of adoration.</li>
<li>In religions without a transcendent deity, the focus is on the search for enlightenment and the primary gesture of adoration is meditative.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="thanksgiving">Thanksgiving</h2>
<ul>
<li>Because one of the basic insights of many religious traditions is that the world and all its bounty flow from the world of the sacred, it is only fitting that such traditions emphasize the need to acknowledge that gift.</li>
<li>The most common form of thanksgiving is the ritual act of giving a gift. Such donations may run from the formal act of a sacrifice, to the leaving of a gift at an altar or shrine</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Ancient Spartan Helot Killing</strong></p>
<p>Ancient Spartan Helot Killing male rite of passage</p>
<p>For ancient Spartans, becoming a soldier was the only way one could be recognized as a man. Military training began at age seven when boys would be taken from their families and placed in the Agoge system. For the next 10 years Spartan boys learned the skills necessary to become a trained killing machine.</p>
<p><strong>Satere-Mawe Bullet Ant Glove</strong></p>
<p>Satere-Mawe Bullet Ant Glove male rite of passage (2:27 min)</p>
<p>Deep in the heart of the Brazilian Amazon lives the Satere-Mawe tribe. To become a man in the Satere-Mawe, a boy must stick his hand in a glove woven with bullet ants and withstand their stings for over 10 minutes without making a noise.</p>
<p><strong>Maasai Warrior Passage</strong></p>
<p>Maasai Warrior boys male rite of passage (5:50 min)</p>
<p>The Maasai of Kenya and Tanzania have a series of rites of passage that carry boys into manhood. Every 10 or 15 years a new warrior class will be initiated into the tribe. Boys between the ages of 10 and 20 are brought together from all across the country. Dozens of houses are built that will serve as the place of initiation. The night before the ceremony, the boys sleep outside in the forest. At dawn, they return to the little makeshift homestead for a day of singing and dancing. They drink a mixture of milk, cow’s blood, and alcohol and eat piles and piles of meat. After the festivities, boys who are of age (12-16) are ready to be circumcised.</p>
<p><strong>Mandan Hook Hanging</strong></p>
<p>Mandan indians Hook Hanging male rite of passage</p>
<p>Native American tribes each had their own unique coming of age rituals for the men in the tribe. But few were as intense as that of the Mandans. Before his rite-of-passage, a Mandan boy fasted for 3 days to cleanse his body of impurities. Then, on the day of the ritual, elders of tribe would pierce the boy’s chest, shoulder, and back muscles with large wooden splints. Ropes, which extended from the roof of a hut, were then attached to the splints, and the young man was winched up into the air, his whole body weight suspended from the ropes. Despite the pain, the boy was not to cry out in pain. While hanging in the air, more splints were hammered through his arms and legs. Skulls of his dead grandfather and other ancestors were placed on the ends of the splints.</p>
<p><strong>Sambia of Papa New Guinea</strong></p>
<p>Sambia Papa New Guinea male rite of passage</p>
<p>In the small country of Papau New Guinea, over 1,000 different culture groups exist. Among them is the Sambia tribe, a group with perhaps the most insane rite of passage into manhood in the world.</p>
<p>The initiation begins at age seven with the separation of the boy from the mother. The boy will spend the rest of his young life only in the presence of men in an all male hut. The gender separation is taken to such extremes that boys and women use different walking paths around the village. …</p>
