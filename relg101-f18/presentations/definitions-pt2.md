## What kind of stuff? : Substance or Function? ##

---

### Functionalist Definition of Religion ###

-   Focuses on the role religion plays in the lives of persons and groups.
-   Might focus on the ways religion enables people to sustain hope in the face of difficult circumstances.
-   “Functionalist” understands **religion** to have to do with the role it plays ordering, making sense, of human existence

---

### Substantive Definition of Religion ###

-   Attempts to limit the phenomena that may be characterized as religious.
-   Seeks to identify what it is that makes certain responses to death and suffering religious and others not.
-   “Substantive” recognizes that **religion** to be contrasted with the many other … isms or ways of thought etc. that function to make life bearable, ordered, etc. (cf. Martineau's definition above)

---

### Definition must be both ###

-   Considerations of function are necessary but not sufficient to the task of defining religion.
-   But an adequate definition of religion must include a substantive component.
-   Thus, **any adequate definition of religion must account for both the function and substance of religion.**

---

1.  **Religion and politics** overlap but are not the same
2.  **Religion and morality** overlap but are not the same
3.  **Religion and science** overlap but are not the same
4.  … **history**?

---

## A Proposed Definition ##

---

### Religion signifies those ways of viewing the world that refer to: ###

1.  a notion of sacred reality
2.  made manifest in human experience
3.  in such a way as to produce long-lasting ways of thinking, feeling, and acting
4.  with respect to problems of ordering and understanding existence

---

## A Notion of Sacred Reality ##

-   A **notion of sacred reality establishes a boundary between religion and non-religion.**
-   **Sacred** indicates a reality that is somehow distinct, set apart, other than **ordinary**.
-   Sacred reality includes the God of the **Bible**, the **Qur'anic Allah**, the **Brahman** of Hinduism, Buddhism's **Nirvana**, the **kami** of Shinto.

---

### Manifest in Human Experience ###

-   Although the sacred is set apart from the ordinary, it nevertheless may be experienced, thought about, and acted upon.
-   Thus, all religion has to do with the element of the **sacred manifesting itself in various ways**: in rituals, persons, and natural phenomena.


Note:
1.  Muslims = the sacred reality (****Allah****) is made manifest through prophecy
2.  Buddhists = the goal of **Nirvana** comes to life in the life and teaching of the Buddha
3.  Navaho = the story of the Navaho people makes wisdom available for those who seek harmony between all things.

---

### Long-Lasting Ways of Thinking and Feeling ###

-   Religious ways develop over time. And they come to constitute traditions that may be identified with the history of particular communities.
-   For example, the prophecy of Muhammad is the beginning of the tradition of Islam.
-   Islam's message and the story of its revelation in seventh-century Arabia have produced characteristic modes of thought, feeling, and action among a large percentage of the world's population.

---

### Ordering and Understanding Existence ###

-   Stresses the way in which notions of sacred reality are related to problems of suffering and death.
-   Also stresses the way in which notions of sacred reality are related to other problems; such as the ordering of political or economic life.
