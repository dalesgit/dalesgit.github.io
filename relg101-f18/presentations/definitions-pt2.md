## Elements of Religion ##

-   Human thought
-   Feeling
-   Action
-   Social interconnectedness
-   Values

---

### Religion and Human Thought ###

**Religion is intimately connected with human thought.**

Even those who focus on practice have beliefs, develop doctrines, and emphasize the importance of certain teachings in the religious life essential to their way of life.

---

### Religion and Feeling ###

To some extent, all religious experience is an emotional experience.

Friedrich Schleiermacher characterized religion as a **feeling of absolute dependence**.

Rudolf Otto, characterized religion as the **experience of the holy**. And this experience is one that inspires feelings of fear, awe, terror, and love.

---

### Religion and Action ###

While the form and place of religious action vary, the importance of action to an understanding of religion is evident.

Examples of religious action:

1.  Islam = the duty of prayer and **salat**
2.  Shinto = approach the shrine of kami by washing, ringing a bell, and clapping their hands
3.  Roman Catholicism = attend mass
4.  Methodism = outer holiness, inner holiness, spreading holiness

---

### Individual and Social Existence ###

-   Most of the great religions make a place for **individual devotion** and encourage persons to search for **union with the ultimate reality**.
-   But we must be careful not to overstress the individual dimension of religion.
    -   One of the most elementary components of religion is some emphasis on the idea of society.
    -   Thus, the essence of religion is the ways in which it enables individual persons to identify with the values associated with a particular group.

---

### Values and Religion ###

In most times and places, religion has been closely connected with morality.

-   To some, religion confirms the moral law and gives one power to perform one's duty.
-   Religion is a way of expressing important societal values.
    -   For example, when believers in various settings pray or offer sacrifices to honor God, or to ward off spirits that threaten tribal unity, they express their sense of what is important in life.

## What kind of stuff? : Substance or Function? ##

---

### Functionalist Definition of Religion ###

-   Focuses on the role religion plays in the lives of persons and groups.
-   Might focus on the ways religion enables people to sustain hope in the face of difficult circumstances.
-   “Functionalist” understands **religion** to have to with the role it plays ordering, making sense, of human existence

---

### Substantive Definition of Religion ###

-   Attempts to limit the phenomena that may be characterized as religious.
-   Seeks to identify what it is that makes certain responses to death and suffering religious and others not.
-   “Substantive” recognizes that **religion** to be contrasted with the many other … isms or ways of thought etc. that function to make life bearable, ordered, etc. (cf. Martineau's definition above)

---

### Definition must be both ###

-   Considerations of function are necessary but not sufficient to the task of defining religion.
-   But an adequate definition of religion must include a substantive component.
-   Thus, **any adequate definition of religion must account for both the function and substance of religion.**

1.  Religion and politics overlap but are not the same
2.  Religion and morality overlap but are not the same
3.  religion and science overlap but are not the same
4.  … history?

---

## A Proposed Definition ##

---

### Religion signifies those ways of viewing the world that refer to: ###

1.  a notion of sacred reality
2.  made manifest in human experience
3.  in such a way as to produce long-lasting ways of thinking, feeling, and acting
4.  with respect to problems of ordering and understanding existence

---

## A Notion of Sacred Reality ##

-   A **notion of sacred reality establishes a boundary between religion and non-religion.**
-   **Sacred** indicates a reality that is somehow distinct, set apart, other than **ordinary**.
-   Sacred reality includes the God of the **Bible**, the **Qur'anic Allah**, the **Brahman** of Hinduism, Buddhism's **Nirvana**, the **kami** of Shinto.

---

### Manifest in Human Experience ###

-   Although the sacred is set apart from the ordinary, it nevertheless may be experienced, thought about, and acted upon.
-   Thus, all religion has to do with the element of the **sacred manifesting itself in various ways**: in rituals, persons, and natural phenomena.

1.  Muslims = the sacred reality (****Allah****) is made manifest through prophecy
2.  Buddhists = the goal of **Nirvana** comes to life in the life and teaching of the Buddha
3.  Navaho = the story of the Navaho people makes wisdom available for those who seek harmony between all things.

---

### Long-Lasting Ways of Thinking and Feeling ###

-   Religious ways develop over time. And they come to constitute traditions that may be identified with the history of particular communities.
-   For example, the prophecy of Muhammad is the beginning of the tradition of Islam.
-   Islam's message and the story of its revelation in seventh-century Arabia have produced characteristic modes of thought, feeling, and action among a large percentage of the world's population.

---

### Ordering and Understanding Existence ###

-   Stresses the way in which notions of sacred reality are related to problems of suffering and death.
-   Also stresses the way in which notions of sacred reality are related to other problems; such as the ordering of political or economic life.
