 to come from a non-Muslim perspective \* Changed "name of
God" to Deity; put "God" in parenthesis after "Allah" \* Maybe the slide
could just have 3 pts (no table) under heading "What is Islam": -
Monotheism (believe Allah), Revealed book = Qur'an, follow Prophet
Muhammad (this approach relates to next slide)

- True Monotheism
- His Name and his oneness
- Try using a table format to organize the content

---


**Islam** means

Submission - Peace - A way of life

---

## Divine Revelation<a id="orgheadline6"></a>

- Quran: Revelation to Prophet
- Hadith: sayings of the Prophet
  - Sunnah is derived from Hadith
- Sunnah: Prophetic Traditions
  - Sayings, actions or approvals of the Prophet Mohammad (pbuh: *Peace be
    upon him*)

Note:
**Sunnah** is the way of the Prophet (SAW). The way prophet (SAW) Acted, prayed, slept and coversed with people etc. 
**Hadith** on the other hand is the sayings of the Prophet(SAW). You can say sunnah is derived from hadith.

---

Note:

- Speaker pt: need to establish definition/distinction of "Islam"

& "Muslim" here so that later slide is indeed a "recap"

"If greatness of purpose, smallness of means, and astounding results are
the three criteria of human genius, who could dare to compare any great
man in modern history with Muhammad?" **Alphonse de Lamartine**

Note: Condense the next 3 slides to one slide, take out the current
slide and merge with the following slides
