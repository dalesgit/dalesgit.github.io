<h3 id="orgheadline3">Overview</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgheadline3">
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Description</dt><dd>The course provides an examination of the varying concepts of religion and the methods used in studying religious behavior and belief. It  provides an introduction to the <b>religious dimension of human existence</b>, and it  examines various <b>concepts of religion and the methods used in studying religious behavior and belief</b>. Through a series of selected readings, the class will reflect on and discuss key elements of the <b>academic study of religion</b>. Discussion and various group activities will highlight experiences that point toward the <b>sacred in the world</b> we live in.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
From lectures and a synthesis of reading reflections, activities and discussions, the class will highlight some of the major questions in the scholarly study of religion. 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>What is religion?</li>
<li>How does or should religion relate to morality?</li>
<li>What is the relation between religion and culture?</li>
<li>What is the relation between religion and evil?</li>
</ul>

<p>
The readings will illustrate that there are a wide variety of ways to approach the study of religion. Through discussion and guided exercises we will reflect critically on our own religious tradition in comparison to other traditions. We will identify some of the ways in which different religious traditions impact the world we live in. Particular attention is paid to the relationship between the three "religions of the Book", <b>Judaism, Christianity, and Islam</b>.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgheadline5">
<p>
RELG 101 helps students make progress toward the following University Level Competencies.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline6" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgheadline6">COMPETENCY 1</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgheadline6">
<p>
<b>Winthrop graduates think critically and solve problems.</b>
Winthrop University graduates reason logically, evaluate and use evidence, and solve problems. They seek out and assess relevant information from multiple viewpoints to form well-reasoned conclusions. Winthrop graduates consider the full context and consequences of their decisions and continually reexamine their own critical thinking process, including the strengths and weaknesses of their arguments.
</p>

<p>
<i>Students are required to use the critical tools of sociology, anthropology, as well as  historical and hermeneutical disciplines to analyze and interpret various religious systems of belief and practice.  The course requires discussion participation, writing assignments, tests, and a presentations to assess students’ progress in this ULC.</i>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline7" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgheadline7">COMPETENCY 2</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgheadline7">
<p>
<b>Winthrop graduates are personally and socially responsible.</b>
Winthrop University graduates value integrity, perceive moral dimensions, and achieve excellence. They take seriously the perspectives of others, practice ethical reasoning, and reflect on experiences. Winthrop graduates have a sense of responsibility to the broader community and contribute to the greater good.
</p>

<p>
<i>As students wrestle with the way in which religion is related to ethics, morality and social justice through class lectures, discussions and journals, the students will reflect on their own approach to personal and social responsibility</i>.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline8" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgheadline8">COMPETENCY 3</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgheadline8">
<p>
<b>Winthrop graduates understand the interconnected nature of the world and the time in which they live.</b>
Winthrop University graduates comprehend the historical, social, and global contexts of their disciplines and their lives. They also recognize how their chosen area of study is inextricably linked to other fields. Winthrop graduates collaborate with members of diverse academic, professional, and cultural communities as informed and engaged citizens.
</p>

<p>
<i>As the students learn to relate the function and meaning of religion as a world-wide phenomenon to their own contemporary lives and experience, they will understand better how we are connected one to another and to the world we live in.</i>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline9" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgheadline9">COMPETENCY 4</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgheadline9">
<p>
<b>Winthrop graduates communicate effectively.</b>
Winthrop University graduates communicate in a manner appropriate to the subject, occasion, and audience. They create texts – including but not limited to written, oral, and visual presentations – that convey content effectively. Mindful of their voice and the impact of their communication, Winthrop graduates successfully express and exchange ideas.
</p>

<p>
<i>Students participate in class discussions and produce multiple forms of writing.  The instructor incorporates comments and suggestions not only on the content of each assignment but also the effectiveness of their communication.</i>

<dt>Class participation</dt><dd>Each student is expected to complete the week's readings ahead of class and to participate actively in activities and discussions.</dd>
<dt>Journals</dt><dd>On a regular basis the student will reflect on the readings by submitting responses to a Google Form®.  A part of the assignment for the reflection is to be present for the discussion on the topic. The rubric for the journals is as follows:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>An A reflection</b> will demonstrate an awareness of the complexities of the assigned reading, making connections with the students' own experience and prior education. It will generally be between 250 &amp; 350 words in length. A response is given to all of the prompts. The student is present for the following class and contributes to the discussion about the reading.</li>
<li><b>A B reflection</b> will demonstrate that the student read the material with accuracy and with some insight, but not making deeper connections. Perhaps not all the questions were answered. The student may not have contributed to the discussion in class.</li>
<li><b>A C reflection</b> gives a cursory, if accurate, response to the readings. The student responded to the journal but was absent from class for the discussion.</li>
</ul></dd>
<dt>Examinations (2 and a final)</dt><dd>The  exams will cover the readings, and the topics covered in class. The final will be cumulative.</dd>
<dt>Papers</dt><dd>There will be three (3) reflection papers. They will be relatively short papers responding to a prompt given by the instructor.

University policy states that you will not receive credit for the course if you miss more than 25% of the class. This class has a stricter requirement. For this class, any classes missed beyond five (5) will reduce your grade. Please note that there are no automatically excused absences. The student is responsible for contacting the instructor in case of sickness, emergencies, sports travel and other engagements that require an absence. Note also that it is the student’s responsibility to make up for any missed work due to absences. Of course missed conversations and presentations are nearly impossible to make up so it is important to keep absences to a minimum. If you have a difficulty that might lead to excessive absence, the student should contact the instructor as soon as possible.

<p>
Students are expected to cultivate personal and academic integrity. Review the student code of conduct for university polices on academic misconduct. Academic misconduct will not be tolerated and will result in a failing grade on the assignment and/or in the course. The full handbook is available online at: <a href="http://www2.winthrop.edu/studentaffairs/handbook/StudentHandbook.pdf">http://www2.winthrop.edu/studentaffairs/handbook/StudentHandbook.pdf</a>.

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline20" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgheadline20">Academic misconduct</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgheadline20">
<p>
As noted in the Student Conduct Code: “Responsibility for good conduct rests with students as adult individuals.” The policy on student academic misconduct is outlined in the “Student Conduct Code Academic Misconduct Policy” in the online Student Handbook which can be accessed at
</p>


<p>
<a href="http://www.winthrop.edu/uploadedFiles/studentconduct/StudentHandbook.pdf">http://www.winthrop.edu/uploadedFiles/studentconduct/StudentHandbook.pdf</a>. Dishonesty is a serious offense in all its forms, whether lying about reasons for an absence or missed assignment or cheating on a test or misrepresenting borrowed material as your own. It can result in a failing grade on a test, assignment, or the course, or even dismissal from the university.
</p>
</div>

<ul class="org-ul"><li><a id="orgheadline21"></a>Plagiarism<br  /><div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgheadline21">
<p>
Plagiarism is the use of someone else’s thoughts, words, ideas, or lines of argument in your own work without appropriate documentation (a parenthetical citation at the end and a listing in “Works Cited”)–whether you use that material in a quotation, paraphrase, or summary. It is a theft of intellectual property and will not be tolerated, whether intentional or not. It is also a violation of the Student Conduct Code (<a href="http://www.winthrop.edu/studentaffairs/Judicial/judcode.htm">http://www.winthrop.edu/studentaffairs/Judicial/judcode.htm</a>). Plagiarism will result in failure on that assignment. Especially serious cases or second offences can result in failure in the course.
</p>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline22" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgheadline22">Cell phones</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgheadline22">
<p>
Cell phones normally have no use in this class and when they are being used in class they reflect disrespect for students and instructors – a violation of the point above about our expectation of respect. Phones should be on silent and kept in your book bag or purse throughout class time unless otherwise instructed. Except with permission, texting or responding to email will result in a “0” for participation for the day. <b>If a cell phone is in evidence during class hours, the owner of the phone will be marked absent for the day</b>. <b>There may or may not be a warning</b>. If a student responds to text messages or email during class they will receive a “0” for the day’s participation.

There are clear uses for computers in the classroom, including; taking notes, reading digital textbooks, looking for reference information, etc. Equally clearly, computers provide easy distraction from the responsibilities we all bring to the classroom, including; checking email, browsing on Facebook®, etc., etc. These devices are allowed in my classroom, but <b>any evidence of using them for anything other than clear classroom work will result in an assignment of “0” for the day’s participation grade</b>.

Participation and engagement are essential elements in the RELG 101 classroom. You should seek to demonstrate your intellectual curiosity through demonstrated knowledge of the reading assignments, thoughtful reflection of the topics, contribution of insightful ideas and consideration of your classmates’ perspectives. Consider the following:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Do you arrive at class on time, each class period, with a positive, open attitude?</li>
<li>Did you critically read the material? Are there markings, highlights, and questions written in your book? Have you completed your reading journals?</li>
<li>Have you thoughtfully considered the readings prior to arriving in class?</li>
<li>Can you answer questions about the current readings and connect these ideas with previous readings in the class?</li>
<li>Do you ask good questions? Do you listen to your peers?</li>
<li>Are your questions and comments deep and related to the reading, or shallow and random?</li>
<li>Are you willing to challenge your thoughts and opinions and those of others in a respectful, open manner? Are you willing to consider “what if I am wrong?”</li>
<li>Disagreement is a basic element of a democratic society. Diverse perspectives are appreciated and encouraged. You are expected to show respect to your instructor and your peers. Students should work to create a classroom community where all perspectives are heard and appreciated. This classroom is a safe environment in which regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, natural origin, religious affiliation, sexual orientation, political beliefs, age, or ability, you will be treated with respect.</li>
</ul>
