## Introduction

- The most basic Buddhist expression of faith is called the triple refuge: 
	- I take refuge in the **Buddha**; 
<li class="fragment">	I take refuge in the **Dharma** [*the Buddhas teaching*]; </li>
<li class="fragment">	I take refuge in the **Samgha** [*the community of the Buddhas followers*].</li>

Note:
The Buddhist tradition will challenge us to look in new ways at some basic religious questions: What is ultimate reality? How can I know it? And does it love me? Many religious traditions emphasize the importance of an immortal soul. This is not so in Buddhism.
