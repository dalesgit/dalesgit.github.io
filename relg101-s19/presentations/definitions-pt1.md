### "What is required is perspective" (p. 8) ###

A North American touring the highlands of New Guinea for a visit to one of the tribes living in the outback might well witness men decorated in bird-of-paradise feathers, nude (save for a penis sheath), covered in ashes, and dancing before a fire at the side of which are pigs bound in vines and banana leaves. His or her first reaction might well be to take some photographs in order to show “the folks back home” some of the exotic aspects of life among primitive peoples. But this picture can be reversed.

Suppose the tribesmen of the outback visit a downtown church on Sunday morning. They observe rows of oddly dressed people (what, after all, is the purpose of a necktie?), notice that some sit while others sing, listen to one person speak at length, and see still others pass plates onto which paper and metal disks are placed. What are these tribesmen to think? Where, after all, are the pigs? The fire? The sacred feathers? In both cases, the observer lacks a sense of perspective and context.

The lesson is a simple one. It is impossible to get at the intention that lies behind religious behavior unless we have a willingness to **enter sympathetically into the cultural worldview of another person**, at least for a moment.

## Possible Definitions of Religion ##

---

|    |     |
|----|----|
| **James Martineau**          | Religion is the belief in an ever living God, that is, in a **Divine Mind and Will** ruling the Universe and holding moral relations with mankind.     |
| **Friedrich Schleiermacher** | Religion is the **feeling of absolute dependence** or the consciousness that the whole of our spontaneous activity comes from a source outside of us . |


Note:
21 April 1805 – 11 January 1900) was an English religious philosopher influential in the history of Unitarianism.

For 45 years he was Professor of Mental and Moral Philosophy and Political Economy in Manchester New College, the principal training college for British Unitarianism.

November 21, 1768 – February 12, 1834) was a German theologian, philosopher, and biblical scholar known for his attempt to reconcile the criticisms of the Enlightenment with traditional Protestant Christianity. He also became influential in the evolution of Higher Criticism, and his work forms part of the foundation of the modern field of hermeneutics. Because of his profound effect on subsequent Christian thought, he is often called the "Father of Modern Liberal Theology" and is considered an early leader in liberal Christianity. The Neo-Orthodoxy movement of the twentieth century, typically (though not without challenge) seen to be spearheaded by Karl Barth, was in many ways an attempt to challenge his influence.

|**Karl Marx**| Religious suffering is, at one and the same time, the expression of real suffering and a protest against real suffering. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people. |
| **Anthony Wallace**|  Religion is a **set of rituals, rationalized by myth**, which mobilizes supernatural powers for the purpose of achieving or preventing transformations of state in man or nature  |


Note:
The nineteenth-century German thinker Karl Marx, the founder and primary theorist of Marxism, had an antithetical and complex attitude to religion, viewing it primarily as "the soul of soulless conditions", the "opium of the people" that had been useful to the ruling classes since it gave the working classes false hope for millennia. At the same time Marx saw religion as a form of protest by the working classes against their poor economic conditions and their alienation.

(April 15, 1923 - October 5, 2015) was a Canadian-American anthropologist who specialized in Native American cultures, especially the Iroquois. His research expressed an interest in the intersection of cultural anthropology and psychology. He was famous for the theory of revitalization movements.

| **Emile Durkheim** | Religion is only  **sentiment inspired by the group in its members**, but projected outside of the consciousness that experiences them, and objectified . |
| **Signmund Freud** | Freud refers to religion as an illusion which is "perhaps the most important item in the psychical inventory of a civilization". In his estimation, religion provides for defense against "the crushingly superior force of nature" and "the urge to rectify the shortcomings of civilization which made themselves painfully felt". He concludes that all religious beliefs are "illusions and insusceptible of proof." |


Note: 
April 15, 1858 – November 15, 1917) was a French sociologist, social psychologist and philosopher. He formally established the academic discipline and—with Karl Marx and Max Weber—is commonly cited as the principal architect of modern social science and father of sociology.

Sigmund Freud's views on religion are described in several of his books and essays. Freud regarded God as an illusion, based on the infantile need for a powerful father figure; religion, necessary to help us restrain violent impulses earlier in the development of civilization, can now be set aside in favor of reason and science.

| James G. **Frazer** | Religion is a propitiation or conciliation of powers superior to man which are believed to direct and control the course of Nature and of human life .                                           |
| **William James**   | The very fact that there are so many (definitions of religion) … is enough to prove that the word “religion” cannot stand for any single principle or essence, but is rather a collective name … |




Note: 
1 January 1854 – 7 May 1941), was a Scottish social anthropologist influential in the early stages of the modern studies of mythology and comparative religion. He is often considered one of the founding fathers of modern anthropology.

His most famous work, The Golden Bough (1890), documents and details the similarities among magical and religious beliefs around the globe. Frazer posited that human belief progressed through three stages: primitive magic, replaced by religion, in turn replaced by science

William James (January 11, 1842 – August 26, 1910) was an American philosopher and psychologist, and the first educator to offer a psychology course in the United States.James was one of the leading thinkers of the late nineteenth century and is believed by many to be one of the most influential philosophers the United States has ever produced, while others have labeled him the "**Father of American psychology**". 
  
Along with Charles Sanders Peirce and John Dewey, James is considered to be one of the major figures associated with the philosophical school known as **pragmatism**, and is also cited as one of the founders of **functional psychology.**

Philosophy of religion
  
Excerpt  
James did important work in philosophy of religion. In his Gifford Lectures at the University of Edinburgh he provided a wide-ranging account of The Varieties of Religious Experience (1902) and interpreted them according to his pragmatic leanings. Some of the important claims he makes in this regard:  
  
Religious genius (experience) should be the primary topic in the study of religion, rather than religious institutions—since institutions are merely the social descendant of genius.  
The intense, even pathological varieties of experience (religious or otherwise) should be sought by psychologists, because they represent the closest thing to a microscope of the mind—that is, they show us in drastically enlarged form the normal processes of things.  
In order to usefully interpret the realm of common, shared experience and history, we must each make certain "over-beliefs" in things which, while they cannot be proven on the basis of experience, help us to live fuller and better lives.

Religious Mysticism is only one half of mysticism, the other half is composed of the insane and both of these are co-located in the 'great subliminal or transmarginal region'.

| **Clifford Geertz** | [Religion is] a system of symbols which acts to establish powerful, persuasive, and long-lasting moods and motivations...by formulating conceptions of a general order of existence and clothing these conceptions with such an aura of factuality that the moods and motivations seem uniquely realistic.  |



Note:
**Joseph Adler** | [Religion is] a means of ultimate transformation and/or orientation.

### A Definition of Religion ###

**cautious, recognizing that we cannot escape our own perspective** 


The very attempt to define religion, to find some distinctive or possibly unique essence or set of qualities that distinguish the "religious" from the remainder of human life, is primarily a Western concern. The attempt is a natural consequence of the Western speculative, intellectualistic, and scientific disposition. It is also the product of the dominant Western religious mode, what is called the Judeo-Christian climate or, more accurately, the theistic inheritance from Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.

## Elements of Religion ##

- Human thought
- Feeling
- Action
- Social interconnectedness
- Values

---

### Religion and Human Thought ###

**Religion is intimately connected with human thought.**

Even those who focus on practice have beliefs, develop doctrines, and emphasize the importance of certain teachings in the religious life essential to their way of life.

---

### Religion and Feeling ###

To some extent, all religious experience is an emotional experience.

Friedrich Schleiermacher characterized religion as a **feeling of absolute dependence**.

Rudolf Otto, characterized religion as the **experience of the holy**. And this experience is one that inspires feelings of fear, awe, terror, and love.

---

### Religion and Action ###

While the form and place of religious action vary, the importance of action to an understanding of religion is evident.

Examples of religious action:

1.  Islam = the duty of prayer and **salat**
2.  Shinto = approach the shrine of kami by washing, ringing a bell, and clapping their hands
3.  Roman Catholicism = attend mass
4.  Methodism = outer holiness, inner holiness, spreading holiness

---

### Individual and Social Existence ###

- Most of the great religions make a place for **individual devotion** and encourage persons to search for **union with the ultimate reality**.
- But we must be careful not to overstress the individual dimension of religion.
    - One of the most elementary components of religion is some emphasis on the idea of society.
    -   Thus, the essence of religion is the ways in which it enables individual persons to identify with the values associated with a particular group.

---

### Values and Religion ###

In most times and places, religion has been closely connected with morality.

- To some, religion confirms the moral law and gives one power to perform one's duty.
- Religion is a way of expressing important societal values.
    - For example, when believers in various settings pray or offer sacrifices to honor God, or to ward off spirits that threaten tribal unity, they express their sense of what is important in life.
