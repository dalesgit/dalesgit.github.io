## Canaanite gods

Referring to the ideas I learned above, I wonder why the Israelites and thus Jews, later became strictly monotheistic. Was it just the gradual evolution and advancement of religious thinkers and practices? Also, what is the nature of Elohim and the Canaanite god El (pg 33)? El & Elohim seem to be very similar, if not possibly the same. If "El" did precede "Elohim" in some ways, does that mean Jews and Christians worship a Canaanite god? If possible, wouldn't this challenge the notion, at least in Christianity, of God's supposedly "unchanging" nature?

## Source theory

After reading the section on the four sources, I would like to study and know specifically which sections of the Pentateuch are composed of what sources and if these sources were used to create other books of the Bible. Or if these sources were not used in creating the other books of the Bible, what was used? How many authors were there? And most importantly, how can we be certain of the accuracy of the Bible when multiple sources were used and written down after years of oral recitation?

## When was the bible written?

On pg 32 I was surprised about how late Genesis was actually written. I knew that the Bible was written a long time after the events happened, but finding out specifically how the Pentateuch came to be was intriguing.

## Ancient Culture

I learned that these founding fathers and mothers were recorded in writing much later than I originally would have guessed.  The stories are not meant to be necessarily historical accurate accounts of what happened when. Rather, these stories were passed down orally, and embodied the idea and meaning of what it meant to be a member of your family, or a descendant of a patriarch.  I also learned more about the idea of polygamy at this time. Typically, in our society (from a christian lens) this would seem automatically like a big no-no. However, after learning some more about the economic and cultural setting or context of these stories, it seems to make more sense and I can understand why, to these characters, story-tellers, and original audiences, this was a perfectly acceptable practice. The importance of the genealogies also stood out to me because they truly were "Those Boring "Begats"" any time I have read through them, though my experience is more with those genealogies present in the New Testament. But after reading through this section, I can understand the importance and respect the power that these sections held for the people of the time.

### Names<a id="sec-1-1-3" name="sec-1-1-3"></a>

## yhwh יהןה

(Yahweh or LORD) *This is the holy name of God; cf. Exodus 3, where Moses learns about this name, although it had been used from the beginning of the text of Genesis. By the time of Jesus, it was no longer pronounced*.

## adonai אדני

(Lord) *This is the ordinary hebrew word which would have referred to a person*. The name "Jehovah" was mistakenly derived from combining the vowels of the word "adonai" with the consonants of the tetragrammaton "yhwh". "HaShem" is used when even saying "adonai" is too holy to speak.

## 'el ; 'E:lohiym אלהים

(God) *"Elohim" is another name used for God. It is a plural form of an older name for God "el"*.

### Timeline of Israel<a id="sec-1-1-6" name="sec-1-1-6"></a>

Referring back to the timeline for the earth and the beginning of written language at about 3,000 BCE, there are some key dates to hold in mind when studying the Hebrew Scriptures.

## History of Interpretation<a id="sec-1-5" name="sec-1-5"></a>

In addition to the challenges of gathering accurate texts and translating them, throughout the last 3 millenia there have been differing understandings of what "scripture" was, what was to be included in it (and obviously excluded)

<li class="fragment">Destruction of temple (1) </li>
<li class="fragment">Destruction of temple (2) </li>
<li class="fragment">Separation of Judaism and Christianity </li>
<li class="fragment">Separation of Greek from Latin church </li>
<li class="fragment">Separation of the Protestant Reformation </li>

## Geography<a id="sec-1-4" name="sec-1-4"></a>

We are talking about a part of the world that is the presumed origin of written language and of civilization, the "fertile crescent", "Mesopotamia" (between the rivers). It is hugely in today's horizon of awareness.

## Why begin ch. 12<a id="sec-1-7" name="sec-1-7"></a>

### What do we need to know?<a id="sec-1-1-2" name="sec-1-1-2"></a>

 When the skies above were not yet named 
 Nor earth below pronounced by name, 
 Apsu, the first one, their begetter, 
 And maker Tiamat, who bore them all, 
Had mixed their waters together, 
But had not formed pastures, nor discovered reed-beds; 
When yet no gods were manifest, 
Nor names pronounced, nor destinies decreed, 
Then gods were born within them...[*]

We are dealing with a culture very different from our own, separated by values, time, etc.

- tribal nomads
- angels and gods
- sacrifice and horned altars
- Canaanite religion
