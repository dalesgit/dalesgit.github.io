<h2 id="questions">Questions</h2>
<li class="fragment">When you attempt to understand a new religious tradition, what is the most important thing to learn? Would you focus on its doctrines, the way it tells stories, its art, its rituals, or its institutions? Would you focus on something else? </li>

</ul>
<p>Note: - e.g. The oldest and most important of these collections contains more than a thousand songs to various gods and goddesses and is aptly named the Rig, meaning praise. Scholars believe it was composed between 2300 and 1200 B.C.E. - many different gods sung to</p>

<li>The Aryans' strong emphasis on <strong>ritual</strong> over <strong>doctrine and belief</strong> - was the basis of the Vedic tradition.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Axial Age (c. 800-200 BCE) = a time of reformation and re-evaluation around the world</li>
<li>changes took place in India, Greece, China, Mesopotamia, &amp; Israel</li>

<li>from <strong>cosmic maintenance</strong> to <strong>personal enlightenment</strong></li>
<li>classical Hinduism established notion of <strong>samsara</strong> and <strong>transmigration of the soul</strong></li>
<li><strong>Karma</strong>, <strong>moksha</strong> became individual experiences</li>
<li><strong>Upanishads</strong> were written</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: - The function of religion changed from that of <strong>cosmic maintenance</strong> to one of <strong>personal enlightenment</strong> and transformation. - Classical Hinduism established the central problem of human existence for Hindus <strong>samsara</strong>, the cycle of continual <strong>transmigrations of the soul</strong>. - <strong>Karma</strong>, even good <strong>karma</strong>, keeps a person bound to the cycle of transmigration. One path the Hindu tradition offers for the attainment of <strong>moksha</strong>, or ultimate release, is the path of wisdom. - The path of wisdom found in the Axial Age, when the most important Hindu responses to the anxieties about death and rebirth were recorded in a collection of texts called the <strong>Upanishads</strong>. The oldest of the <strong>Upanishads</strong> was probably composed between 800--400 B.C.E., but actually written down much later. called the <strong>Upanishads</strong>. The oldest of the <strong>Upanishads</strong> was probably composed between 800--400 B.C.E., but actually written down much later. - Modern Hinduism has had to face challenges brought by the advent of Islam and Western culture.</p>
