<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<ul>
<li>During its 2,500-year history, from the time of the Buddha to the present day, Buddhism has grown from a tiny religious community in northern India into a movement that now spans the globe.</li>
<li>the tradition begins simply with a <strong>human being â€“ Siddhartha Gautama</strong> who found a solution to the problem of human suffering.</li>
<li>Buddhists focus on his experience, and they <strong>deny the existence of a single, almighty God.</strong></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>The most basic Buddhist expression of faith is called the triple refuge:
<ul>
<li>I take refuge in the <strong>Buddha</strong>;</li>
<li>I take refuge in the <strong>Dharma</strong> [<em>the Buddhas teaching</em>];</li>
<li>I take refuge in the <strong>Samgha</strong> [<em>the community of the Buddhas followers</em>].</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Note: The Buddhist tradition will challenge us to look in new ways at some basic religious questions: What is ultimate reality? How can I know it? And does it love me? Many religious traditions emphasize the importance of an immortal soul. This is not so in Buddhism.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="buddha">Buddha</h2>
<ul>
<li>The doctrine of reincarnation or rebirth is known as <strong>samsara</strong> (literally, <em>wandering</em>). Samsara was not considered a pleasant prospect. For many people, it was not an opportunity as much as it was a burden, and they tried to find a way out.</li>
<li>The release from <strong>samsara</strong> is found in <strong>moksha</strong></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="four-noble-truths-are">Four Noble Truths are:</h3>
<ol>
<li>the truth of suffering (<strong>Gurkha</strong>): <em>all is suffering</em></li>
<li>the truth of the cause of suffering: <em>it is from desire</em></li>
<li>the truth of the cessation of suffering (also known as <strong>nirvana</strong> or <strong>nibbana</strong>): <em>i.e. cease from desire</em></li>
<li>the truth of the path that leads to the cessation of suffering: <em>via 8-fold path</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Note: Buddhists have a rich tradition of stories and legends about the Buddha. The stories begin with the Buddhas previous lives. Buddhist tradition arose at a time when the doctrine of reincarnation was a basic assumption in Indian religious life.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="the-path-to-nirvana-is-divided-into-eight-categories">The path to nirvana is divided into eight categories:</h2>
<ul>
<li>right understanding,</li>
<li>right thought,</li>
<li>right speech,</li>
<li>right action,</li>
<li>right livelihood,</li>
<li>right effort,</li>
<li>right mindfulness,</li>
<li>right concentration.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>The logic might be expressed in 3 categories:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>sila</strong>, or moral conduct;</li>
<li><strong>samadhi</strong>, or mental concentration; and</li>
<li><strong>pa-a</strong>, or wisdom</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The contents of the Buddhist scriptures often are quite simple and pragmatic.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="mahayana-arose-as-reform-ca.-beginning-of-common-era">Mahayana arose as reform ca. beginning of common era</h2>
<ul>
<li>spread to China, Tibet, Japan, Korea, Vietnam</li>
<li>One of the Mahayana traditions most important innovations is the <strong>bodhisattva</strong> ideal. A <strong>bodhisattva</strong> is a Buddha-to-be or future Buddha who does not attempt to go straight to <strong>nirvana</strong> but returns to this world to help others along the path.</li>
<li><strong>emptiness</strong>: Hinduism there is an eternal self. Buddhism there is <strong>no-self</strong></li>
<li><strong>non-duality</strong> (physical / spiritual)</li>
</ul>

<li>Burma / Myanmar</li>
<li>Tibet</li>

<h2 id="chinese-adoption-of-buddhism-blended-with-an-adaptation-of-chinese-taoism">Chinese adoption of Buddhism blended with an adaptation of Chinese Taoism</h2>
<p>The Tao that can be told of is not the eternal Tao; The name that can be named is not the eternal name. The Nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth; The Named is the mother of all things.<br />
The Tao is empty like a bowl.<br />
It may be used but its capacity is never exhausted.</p>
